    <tour_name>China's Captivating Visions &amp; Timeless Horizons</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;&#x201C;The sights, sounds, landscapes and people of China continue to draw me back time and again. &#xA0;It is a captivating country of vast contrast and endless fascination.&#xA0; As we watch a new China emerging so quickly and its people changing to fit into a new world of modern development and change, I am concerned that very soon traditional cultures and customs that are at the heart of China&#x2019;s appeal may soon be a thing of the past. &#xA0;That is the reason behind this itinerary.&#xA0; I want to take people well off the beaten path to see and experience the everyday life of rural southern China, its folk traditions, incredible landscapes and welcoming people.&#xA0; The contrast between that and the world city of Shanghai is startling, and most definitely reveals the struggle to find a balance that works.&#xA0; I urge my clients who want to see China to do it now before it&#x2019;s gone.&#x201D;&#xA0; Colin Rose, Destination Specialist&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;div&gt;Relish a pleasant Li River cruise through exceptional scenery &#x2013; valleys, bamboo groves, misty limestone pinnacles and ancient rock formations&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;Discover Yungang Grottos, some 53 caves&#xA0;completed during the Northern Wei Dynasty dating between 460 and 494 AD&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;Immerse yourself in the vibrant culture of Shanghai, as much a city of the present and future as Hongcun is a village of the past&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;See the amazing Hanging Temples, dating back 1,400 years, that seem to hang mid-air&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;Experience beautiful Mt. Huangshan, Yellow Mountain, a UNESCO World Cultural and Natural Heritage Site, known for magnificent sunrises&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;Your focus this morning is the impressive Amber Fort, a superb example of Rajput (Medieval Hindu) style of architecture.&#xA0; You will ride up the ramparts to this hilltop as generations before you have&#x2026; on the back of a caparisoned elephant.&#xA0; Pass through the ancient main gate, where Maharajas of Jaipur have entered for four hundred years. &#xA0;Learn about the history of this architectural masterwork and its mirror-studded alcoves, dazzling mosaics and water-cooled swings.&#xA0; The Hawa Mahal, Palace of the Winds, is a five-story structure of pink sandstone with semi-octagonal and delicately honeycombed windows that overlook the main street of the old city. &#xA0;It was constructed in 1799 so that the veiled royal women would not be seen as they looked out at the world through 593 stone screens.&#xA0; City Palace in the heart of the old city is a blend of Rajasthani and Mughal architecture.&#xA0; The center of the complex is seven-story Chandra Palace.&#xA0; Next door, Solar Observatory is an astronomical treasure house with a solar device that gives accurate predictions still.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Rambagh Palace &#x2013; Royal Suite (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 12:&#xA0; Jaipur / Udaipur (Private Jet &#x2013; Falcon 2000)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;When your private jet lands in Udaipur, you will be met and privately transferred to your hotel, the island Taj Lake Palace.&#xA0; In the middle of Lake Pichola, this white marble and mosaic royal residence was built in 1746.&#xA0; It spreads across a four-acre island.&#xA0; It is both beautiful traditional and comfortably contemporary, insuring that each guest feels like royalty.&#xA0; On an evening cruise, take in the scenes of daily life, bathing and laundry, and beyond he banks, the city and its great palace.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Lake Palace &#x2013; Royal Suite (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Your touring while in Udaipur will be in either Chrysler 1948 Windsor or 1926 Chevrolet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 13:&#xA0; Udaipur&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Udaipur is a cool oasis in the dry heart of Rajasthan.&#xA0; The huge city palace towers over the Lake Pichola and is the largest palace complex in Rajasthan.&#xA0; It is a collection of architectural styles as it was built by a succession of rulers.&#xA0; Even so, it manages to retain a uniformity of design.&#xA0; Jagadish Temple enshrines a black stone image of Lord Vishnu with a brass image of his &#x2018;vehicle&#x2019;&#x2013; a mighty bird, garuda.&#xA0; The temple is an exquisite example of Indo-Aryan Art.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Vintage &amp;amp; Classic Car Collection was unveiled to the public on February 15, 2000 at the Palace Udaipur. &#xA0;Here, for the first time, people had the opportunity to see this astonishing collection of cars. &#xA0;All the vehicles on show have belonged to the Maharanas of Mewar, both past and present.&#xA0; Despite some vehicles being over seventy years old, each one has been painstakingly restored so that they are in working order.&#xD;
&#xD;
The collection is housed in the original former Mewar State Motor Garage, a grand setting for such a fine assortment of vehicles.&#xA0; The semi-circular motor garage with its forecourt is housed within a greater courtyard, creating a pleasant hideaway from the bustle of the streets.&#xA0; One of the original Shell petrol pump is not only still standing, but also in a usable condition. &#xA0;The motor garage itself was built at a time when the only cars in town belonged to the Mewar State Motor Garage, and the present day surroundings make this garage as wonderfully stylish as it must always have been.&#xA0; The fascinating collection ranges from a 1950 Morris Minor, to a 1934 Rolls - Royce Phantom II, to a 1946 MG TC, to a 1947 Vauxhall 12, which was one of the first cars to be restored in the palace workshop.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Lake Palace &#x2013; Royal Suite (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 14:&#xA0; Udaipur / Mumbai (Private Jet &#x2013; Falcon 2000)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Fly to Mumbai, where you are and privately transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; Set out by boat to Elephanta Island, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&#xA0; Here, you tour Elephanta Caves, which contain sculptures and high reliefs in stone of Hindu deities.&#xA0; These works of art were created over the years beginning late in the sixth century.&#xA0; The cave entrance is reached by climbing more than 100 steps to the top of a hill.&#xA0; Inside, a large hall features rows of columns that appear to hold up the roof of the cave.&#xA0; Crossbeams complete the illusion of a ceiling.&#xA0; A series of captivating sculptured panels, nine in all, are set like a tableau.&#xA0; Little is known about the creators of this ancient architecture, however, what they left behind seems infused with a life of their own.&#xA0; The magical interplay of light and shade only intensifies the overall atmosphere. &#xA0;The temple is symmetrical, with the important focal points worked out in a geometrical mandala, the mysti&#xD;
design that represents an energy field. &#xA0;Four entrances to the shrine are flanked by large guardian figures.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Taj Mahal Palace &amp;amp; Tower &#x2013; Grand Luxury Sea View (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Your touring while in Mumbai will be by Jaguar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 15:&#xA0; Mumbai&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, engage with the energy and frenzy of Mumbai.&#xA0; Like so much of India, this city of 15 million is a bundle of contradictions.&#xA0; Brushed by breezes off the Arabian Sea, its weathered Victorian mansions, some still privately owned, and many of the grand public buildings stand as quiet testimony to the days of the British Raj.&#xA0; But Mumbai today is a vibrant, often aggressive mix of both affluence and poverty, modernity and tradition.&#xA0; Mumbai&#x2019;s landmark is the Gateway to India.&#xA0; This elegant stone archway dates from the days when Mumbai was known as Bombay; and it was hastily erected in 1911 as a symbol of welcome to Queen Mary and King George V of England on their visit to India.&#xA0; Later, artisans added decorative carvings and lovely window carvings.&#xA0; The hanging gardens above Malabar Hill were laid out in the early 1880s. &#xA0;From there, you enjoy panoramic views of the Arabian Sea.&#xA0; The Prince of Wales Museum exhibits a rich collection of antique miniature paintings, Nepalese and Tibetan art, while Jehangir Gallery focuses on contemporary Indian artists.&#xA0; Mani Bhavan is now a museum dedicated to its former occupant, one of the great leaders of the modern world, Mahatma Gandhi.&#xA0; Stroll through teeming bazaars crammed with antiques, jewelry, produce, flowers, and an array of handcrafted wares.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Taj Mahal Palace &amp;amp; Tower &#x2013; Grand Luxury Sea View (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 16:&#xA0; Mumbai / Depart&#xD;

&amp;nbsp;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Amman, Jordan&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you arrive in Amman, the capital of Jordan.&#xA0; After clearing customs at the Queen Alia Airport, you meet your Big Five Tours &amp;amp; Expeditions representative who will transfer you to the hotel.&#xA0; This evening you are driven to Fakhr El-Din restaurant for dinner-then back to the Four Seasons hotel for overnight.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Amman &#x2013; Executive Suite (D)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Amman / Jerash / Amman&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, begin your tour of this ancient city, Amman.&#xA0; The capital since 1921, Amman contains about a third of the population of Jordan.&#xA0; It was formerly the Ammonite capital of Rabbath-Ammon and later the Greco-Roman city of Philadelphia.&#xA0; Often referred to as the 'white city', Amman was originally, like Rome, built on seven hills.&#xA0; With extensive modernization, Amman is well-equipped with excellent hotels and tourist facilities.&#xA0; The busy central market (souk) offers a glimpse of a more traditional city.&#xA0; Traces from Roman, Greek and Ottoman Turk occupations of the region are found throughout the city.&#xA0; In the center of the city is the dramatic Roman amphitheatre, which dates from the 2nd century A.D.&#xA0; Amman&#x2019;s Citadel offers stunning views of the city.&#xD;
&#xD;
Discover the distinctive collection of vintage cars at the Royal Automobile Museum, which includes such classics as a 1936 Cord Westchester, a 1916 Cadillac, a Mercedes C-111, a 1952 Aston Martin DB2, and a classic Rolls Royce as well as a variety of vintage motorcycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
North of Amman lays Jerash, the Roman city of Gerasa. Jerash has some of the finest, most extensive and well-preserved remains of the former empire to be found anywhere.&#xA0; The colonnaded streets, temples, theatres, bathhouses and magnificent oval plaza are complemented by the superbly restored hippodrome, which in Roman times seated up to 15,000 people.&#xA0; Here, the Roman Army and Chariot Experience offers a glimpse of the past, when the Roman Army spanned the centuries from around 700 BC to the fall of Constantinople in 1453 AD &#x2013; more than 2,000 years.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Amman &#x2013; Executive Suite (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Amman / Madaba / Mount&#xA0;Nebo / Karak / Petra&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, travel along the King&#x2019;s Highway for a fascinating day that features many of Jordan&#x2019;s unique treasures.&#xA0;&#xA0;Madaba is home to the oldest known mosaic map of the Holy Land, dating back to the 6th century and is housed at the Saint George&#x2019;s Greek-Orthodox Church.&#xA0; The Archaeological Museum of Madaba also has several other priceless mosaics from the Byzantine era.&#xA0; Mount Nebo is said to be the burial site of Moses; and it was from here that he saw the Holy Land for the first time.&#xA0; En route, you stop at Kerak Castle, a massive crusader castle in the Kerak Mountains.&#xA0; The locality of al-Kerak, now the site of a flourishing town, is known for the imposing fort erected in the first half of the 12th century by the Crusaders.&#xA0; It was later conquered by the Arabs.&#xA0; Travel on to the legendary Rose City of Petra, Jordan's premier national treasure, and by far its best-known tourist attraction.&#xA0; Fans of the Indiana Jones movies may recognize it from &#x201C;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.&#x201D;&#xD;
&#xD;
Admired for its refined culture, massive architecture and ingenious complex of dams and water channels, Petra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is about three-hour drive south of Amman.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt; Movenpick Petra &#x2013; Junior Suite (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Petra&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, you explore Petra.&#xA0; It is the legacy of the Nabateans, an industrious Arab people who settled in southern Jordan more than 2000 years ago.&#xA0; From the main entrance, you walk through the awesome "SIQ," an immense crack in the sandstone that winds for one kilometer between overhanging cliffs. &#xA0;Petra's most famous monument, the Treasury, appears dramatically at the end of the Siq.&#xA0; Petra reveals itself through the many walks and climbs around the ruins of the city.&#xA0; Hundreds of buildings remain including facades, tombs, baths, funerary halls, temples and a 3000-seat theatre from the 1st Century AD.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Movenpick Petra &#x2013; Junior Suite (B,D)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Petra / Bethany / Ma&#x2019;in Hot Springs&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Travel to Bethany, the baptism site where John the Baptist baptized Jesus. &#xA0;Located at the natural hill at Tell El Kharrar where John the Baptist lived, preached and baptized, the village of Bethany Beyond the Jordan River was explicitly mentioned in the Bible.&#xA0; Lying 866 feet below sea level, Ma&#x2019;In Hot Springs is the inspired site for the well-appointed Evason Ma&#x2019;In Hot Springs.&#xA0; Like an oasis in the dramatic terrain, the property defines the resort and spa experience in the Middle East.&#xA0; It is perfect for those seeking a relaxing retreat to be pampered and enjoy the therapeutic benefits of Ma&#x2019;In hot spring waterfalls.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Evason&#xA0;Ma&#x2019;in &#x2013; One Bedroom Suite (B,D)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6: &#xA0;Ma&#x2019;in Hot Springs&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After a leisurely morning, you will be taken to the Marriott Dead Sea Hotel to relax at their pools and play on the crystal shores of the Dead Sea.&#xA0; After lunch at the hotel, you will be transferred back to your hotel, Evason Ma'in,&#xA0;where the remainder of the day is at leisure for you to use as you wish.&#xA0; Perhaps enjoy an optional rejuvenating treatments at the spa.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Evason&#xA0; Ma&#x2019;in &#x2013; One Bedroom Suite (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

Today you will have a private transfer to Queen Alia International airport for your flight to Dubai.&#xA0; Upon arrival, you will be met and privately transferred to Six Senses Hideaway Zighy Bay, located on the northern Musandam Peninsula in the Sultanate of Oman.&#xA0; Zighy Bay is about 75 miles, a 90-minutes drive from Dubai International Airport.&#xD;
&#xD;
You will be taken to the top of the hill overlooking the bay.&#xA0; Guests have a choice of arrival experiences, which include a scenic 15-minute speed boat trip or a drive down from the top of the hill overlooking the bay.&#xA0; Many guests, however, opt to float down to the beach on a paraglider!&#xD;
&#xD;
The indigenous village-style resort and private marina are nudged up against mountains on one side and the mile-long sandy beach at Zighy Bay on the other.&#xA0; The resort is infused with a blend of the surrounding traditional Omani village-style with modern amenities that provide luxury amid local cultural themes.&#xA0; The villas offer a spacious, personal environment with rustic chic d&#xE9;cor.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Six Senses Hideaway &#x2013; Pool Villa Suite Beach Front (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Lima, Peru&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Welcome to Peru!&#xA0; After clearing the customs hall, you will be met by a representative from Big Five, who will assist you with your private transfer to your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Miraflores Park Hotel &#x2013; Junior Suite&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: &#xA0;Lima / Pisco / Nazca / Paracas&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, you fly by private charter flight to the town of Pisco, where you board your private light aircraft for a one hour and 45 minute flight over the famous Nazca Lines.&#xA0; These lines are a series of geoglyphs in the Nazca Desert, a high arid plateau that stretches more than 50 miles.&#xA0; They are largely believed to have been created by the Nazca culture between 200 BC and 700 AD.&#xA0; There are hundreds of individual figures, ranging in complexity that include stylized hummingbirds, spiders, monkeys, fish, sharks or orcas, llamas and lizards.&#xA0; The lines are shallow designs in the ground where the reddish pebbles that cover the surrounding landscape have been removed, revealing the whitish earth underneath.&#xA0; More than 70 drawings are natural or human figures. &#xA0;The largest are over 600 feet across.&#xA0; The true nature of their meaning might never be known, but many believe the lines have religious significance.&#xA0; Spiders, birds, and plants could be fertility symbols.&#xA0; Other possible explanations include: irrigation schemes, and giant astronomical calendars.&#xA0; The dry, windless, stable climate of the plateau has preserved the lines to this day, for the most part.&#xA0; The origin and significance of the Nazca markings still puzzle archaeologists.&#xA0; Maria Rieche, a German scientist who has devoted her life to the study of these fascinating markings, has a more prosaic theory. &#xA0;That they made up a huge calendar employed for agricultural purposes by the people who lived in the area thousands of years ago.&#xA0; After the flight, you will be transferred to your hotel for check-in and to freshen up.&#xA0;&#xA0;This afternoon, combine nature with adrenaline as you set out in a Toyota Land Cruiser with your experienced driver to explore one of the driest desert environments in the world.&#xA0; Enjoy sunset on the desert followed by an unforgettable dinner under the stars.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Libertador Paracas Resort &amp;amp; Spa &#x2013; Suite (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Paracas&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, board your private deluxe yacht for a short cruise to the Ballestas Islands, where you will see the Candelabro, one of the largest of all geoglyphs.&#xA0; It is a 700-foot-high trident on the mountain side at the bay of Paracas.&#xA0; No-one knows for certain the age of the original carving.&#xA0; From you boat, you watch for sea lions, Humboldt penguins, cormorants, boobies, pelicans and maybe even condors.&#xA0; You may also glimpse dolphins and whales.&#xA0; Return to your hotel where the remainder of the morning is at leisure until your lunch.&#xD;
&#xD;
This afternoon we have a tour for brandy lovers.&#xA0; You will be taken to &#x201C;Hacienda Hoja Redonda&#x201D; in Chincha where you can learn about Pisco.&#xA0; Stroll through the vineyards and enjoy sampling varieties of Pisco.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Libertador Paracas Resort &amp;amp; Spa &#x2013; Suite (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Paracas / Cusco / Urubamba (Sacred) Valley&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Fly by private charter this morning to Cusco.&#xA0; Upon arrival, you will be met and driven into the fertile Urubamba (Sacred) Valley.&#xA0; Tour the village of Pisaq, which boasts one of the most colorful Indian Markets in Peru.&#xA0; After lunch at a local restaurant, you continue to Ollantaytambo to discover a beautiful and tranquil village, which is the site of spectacular and extensive Inca ruins.&#xA0; Most of them are enclosed with a Temple Fortress.&#xA0; The unfinished temple, begun by the Pachacuti, contains some of the largest stones ever used by the Inca builders.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Aranwa Hotel &#x2013; Junior Suite (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: &#xA0;Urubamba Valley&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, you are in for a special treat!&#xA0; You have the opportunity to experience the Peruvian Andes as one of the magnificent condors might&#x2026; paragliding over the landscapes on a tandem flight.&#xA0; The mild climate, the varied and dramatic scenery of snow-capped mountains, flowering meadows, lush green hills make the valley an excellent area for paragliding.&#xD;
&#xD;
The focus this afternoon is a whitewater rafting adventure.&#xA0; The river starts gently with time to practice the maneuvers required, then builds up with more fun rapids through a beautiful canyon where you will hopefully see torrents ducks and views of the surrounding peaks.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Aranwa Hotel &#x2013; Junior Suite (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Important Note:&#xA0; This evening you will need to pack a small bag for your rail journey tomorrow.&#xA0; For all Perurail journeys, each passenger is allowed 1 bag or backpack which must not exceed 5 kg/11 pounds and/or 62 inches/157cm (length + height + width).&#xA0; Please pack light.&#xA0; Baggage that exceeds these measurements will not be allowed.&#xA0; Your additional luggage will be stored by your Big Five representative.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Urubamba Valley / Machu Picchu&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
You are driven to Poroy Rail Station to board the Hiram Bingham train bound for Machu Picchu.&#xA0; The train journey to Machu Picchu is a highlight of any trip to the Andes.&#xA0;&#xA0;The Hiram Bingham will depart Poroy Station at about 9:00 a.m.&#xA0; You will enjoy brunch on board while watching the spectacular scenery as it unfolds through the large windows.&#xA0; The 3 &#xBD;-hour journey takes you through the Urubamba Valley, passing by lush, green fields and colorful villages, through rugged mountain passes before it arrives at the train station of Aguas Calientes around 12:30pm.&#xD;
&#xD;
Your private guide greets you and transfers you by small buses to the entrance of the majestic ruins.&#xA0; Machu Picchu rises to an altitude of 7,900 feet above sea level, and nestles between the Huayna Picchu (young peak) and Machu Picchu (old peak).&#xA0; It lies within the spectacular framework provided by the exuberant vegetation of nearby jungle and the rugged mountainous landscape.&#xD;
&#xD;
The ruins are situated on the eastern slope of Machu Picchu.&#xA0; Although constructions show different levels of architecture, the religious buildings exhibit a high degree of perfection. &#xA0;The buildings were constructed with stone and the roofs were built with tree trunks and thatched with ichu straw.&#xA0; The walls were made with an inward inclination for protection against earthquakes.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Machu&#xA0;Picchu Sanctuary Lodge &#x2013; Suite (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Machu Picchu / Cusco&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
You are at leisure to relax or, you can return to Machu Picchu.&#xA0; This will allow you to experience the ruins at sunrise (weather permitting). &#xA0;Even with the blue-gray mist many mornings, it is still worth going early to watch the rolling layers of mist slip across the face of the ruins&#x2026; a site you will long remember.&#xA0; For a truly mystical experience, we advise those early risers energetic enough to also hike to Huayna Picchu peak, opposite Machu Picchu, or even walk to the Sun Gate, the last section of the famous Inca Trail.&#xA0; Late this afternoon, board the Hiram Bingham for your return journey to Cusco.&#xA0; Once on board, pre-dinner cocktails and live entertainment will be in the bar.&#xA0; After drinks, savor a delightful four-course dinner.&#xA0; Upon arrival into Poroy station, you are met and privately transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;La Casona Cusco &#x2013; Suite Balcon (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; Cusco&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
High in the Andes at nearly 11,400 feet above sea level, Cusco is considered the oldest continuously inhabited city in the Western Hemisphere.&#xA0; Founded in the 15th century by the Incas, it was later conquered by Spain, and much of its architecture reflects the dramatic Spanish style of what is known as Cusco Baroque.&#xA0; The Inca influence is also found throughout the city.&#xA0; The Incas conceived their capital in the shape of a Puma with the river serving as the spine, Sacsayhuaman the head and the main city center the body.&#xA0; Almost every central street has remains of Inca walls, arches and doorways. &#xA0;Many streets are lined with Inca stonework, now serving as foundations for more modern buildings.&#xA0; Inca stonework is tapered upwards (battered) and every wall has a perfect line of inclination towards the center, from bottom to top.&#xA0; The stones have each edge and corner rounded.&#xD;
&#xD;
Savor the ambiance of the city as you drive its main streets.&#xA0; Visit the Qorikancha (Sun Temple) now referred to as Santo Domingo Church.&#xA0; The curved stonework of the temple is probably unequalled in the world.&#xA0; During the Inca period, the stones were covered with gold.&#xA0; Then, visit the archaeological sites that surround Cusco:&#xA0; the Saqsayhuaman Fortress, an amazing site with huge stone constructions.&#xA0; The site is said to have great cosmic energy; and many believe that it was an astronomical observatory and an Inca oracle.&#xA0; Also visit Q&#x2019;enqo, a ceremonial center used for worship.&#xA0; Return to the city, and visit the San Pedro local market where you observe the everyday life of Cusco.&#xA0; Travel on to &#x201C;San Blas,&#x201D; an artisans&#x2019; neighborhood of narrow and high streets, and a beautiful little plaza, where the artists create works of art using wool, wood, clay and other materials. &#xA0;Continue to see the famous Twelve Angles stone, part of the largest Inca wall of Cusco, which used to be the Hatunrumiyoc (Big Stone) Palace, built by Inca Sinchi Roca. &#xA0;This is an example of Inca skill with polygonal masonry.&#xD;
&#xD;
This afternoon, you are invited to visit to Villa Tipon, the private farm house of Big Five&#x2019;s Peru In-Country Manager.&#xA0; Here, you welcomed to enjoy a light, home-cooked lunch hosted by the owners, Mr. and Mrs. Marco Bustamante.&#xA0; This evening dine at Chicha Restaurant, part of Gaston&#x2019;s restaurant chain known for low-key charm and wonderful menus that incorporate traditional local and regional flavors of Peru.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;La Casona Cusco &#x2013; Suite Balcon (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; Cusco / Lima&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Transfer to the airport for your private charter flight to Lima.&#xA0; Upon arrival, you are met by your private guide and driven along the Pan-American Highway with its views across the beautiful Pacific Ocean beaches.&#xA0; Travel to the pre-Inca ruins of Pachacamac and its Temple of the Sun and the Palace of the Virgins. &#xA0;In the afternoon transfer to Hacienda Tres Ca&#xF1;as to visit the museum and little church located in the Hacienda before enjoying a delicious Creole buffet lunch while watching an exhibition of the famous Peruvian Paso Horse.&#xA0; You will then be transferred to your hotel where you have the remainder of the day at leisure to explore the city on your own.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Miraflores Park Hotel &#x2013; Junior Suite (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10:&#xA0; Lima / Depart&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;After a leisurely breakfast, you will fly to Chengdu, one of the most important economic centers, transportation and communication hubs in Western China.&#xA0; More than 4,000 years ago, the pre-historical Bronze Age culture of Jinsha established itself in this region.&#xA0; The fertile Chengdu Plain is called Tianfuzhi guo, "the country of heaven," or "the land of abundance."&#xA0; It was recently named China's 4th-most livable city by China Daily.&#xA0; Upon arrival you will be met and taken on a visit of the Panda Breeding Center before going to your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Crowne Plaza Hotel Chengdu &#x2013; Superior Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

This morning&#x2019;s focus is the Jinsha Museum, located about 50 kilometers from Sanxingdui.&#xA0; This site of the Jinsha Museum flourished around 1,000 BC and shares similarities in burial objects with the Sanxingdui site. &#xA0;Ivory, jade, bronze, gold and carved stone artifacts have been found at the site.&#xA0; Unlike the site at Sanxingdui, Jinsha did not have a city wall.&#xA0; After lunch in a local restaurant you will drive to Guanghan County to visit the Sanxingdui Musuem.&#xA0; Explore the museum accompanied by one of the archaeologists who discovered the Sanxingdui Site.&#xA0; (If the archaeologist is not available, we will arrange for a Museum guide to accompany you).&#xA0; Return to Chengdu where the remainder of the evening is at leisure.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Crowne Plaza Hotel Chengdu &#x2013; Superior Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>Jordan:  A Journey Back in Time</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&#x201C;I am fascinated by Jordan.&#xA0; It has such a wonderful combination of elements &#x2013; history, desert kingdoms and almost theatrical landscapes from Wadi Rum to the Dead Sea &#x2013; that combine to create an irresistible journey of mystery and drama.&#xA0; Petra is just one example with its amazing SIQ passage that leads into a canyon of 2,000-year-old buildings carved into mountainsides. You walk through this long narrow fissure in the sandstone, when suddenly right in front of your eyes this incredible ancient city opens to you with the Treasury building the first thing you see.&#xA0;&#xA0; It is absolutely breathtaking.&#x201D;&#xA0; Tatiana Johnston, Destination&#xA0;Specialist&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;Experience fabled Petra by night in the light of 1,800 candles, as you walk through the narrow canyon, known as the Siq, along a candlelit path while you hear the enchanting and haunting music of the Bedouins around you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Explore the vast beauty of Wadi Rum in a 4x4 vehicle that takes you deep into the desert; and discover secluded areas on a camel or by mountain bike.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Enjoy an unforgettable desert adventure with an overnight stay in a deluxe tent at a Bedouin Camp. Sit by the fire under the starry desert sky and enjoy traditional Arabian entertainment.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Discover Jerash, the Roman city of Gerasa, where some of the finest and well-preserved remains are found including colonnaded streets, temples, theaters, bathhouses, magnificent oval plaza and the superbly restored hippodrome that once seated up to 15,000 people.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Savor a wonderful massage at your Dead Sea resort &#x2013; compliments of Big Five.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Amman, Jordan&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Welcome to Amman, the capital of Jordan.&#xA0; After clearing customs at Queen Alia airport, you meet your Big Five Tours &amp;amp; Expeditions representative who escorts you to the hotel.&#xA0; Remainder of the day is yours to relax and enjoy your hotel&#x2019;s amenities.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Amman&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Amman &#x2013; Jerash &#x2013; Amman&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, you drive to visit Jerash, also known as the Roman city of Gerasa.&#xA0; Here you&#x2019;ll see some of the finest, most extensive and well-preserved remains of the former empire to be found anywhere.&#xA0; The colonnaded streets, temples, theaters, bathhouses and magnificent oval plaza are complemented by the superbly restored hippodrome.&#xA0; In the time of Romans it seated up to 15,000 people.&#xA0; Explore Amman, both the modem and ancient capital of Jordan.&#xA0; It has also gone by the names Rabat and in Greco-Roman times Philadelphia.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Amman (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Amman / Mt. Nebo / Madaba / Karak / Petra&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, travel to Mount Nebo - Moses' mountain as mentioned in the New Testament.&#xA0; It is believed that it was here where Moses died after wandering with his people through the desert for forty years.&#xA0; At the top of the mountain you get a grand view of the Dead Sea. &#xA0;In favorable weather you can see as far as Jerusalem.&#xA0; Then drive to the town of Madaba to view the oldest known mosaic map of the Holy Land, dating back the 6th century AD, at the Saint George&#x2019;s Greek-Orthodox Church.&#xA0; The Archaeological Museum of Madaba houses numerous mosaics from the Byzantine era.&#xA0; Continue along the Kings Highway to Karak Castle, a massive crusader castle in the Karak Mountains.&#xA0; The locality of al-Karak, now the site of a flourishing town, is known for the imposing fort erected in the first half of the 12th century by the Crusaders, later conquered by the Arabs.&#xA0; You journey to Petra, one of Jordan most priceless national treasures.&#xA0; About three hours south of Amman, Petra is the legacy of the Nabateans, an industrious Arab people who settled in southern Jordan more than 2000 years ago.&#xA0; The Rose City was carved out of rock canyon walls, and was admired for its massive architecture and ingenious complex of dams and water channels.&#xA0; Petra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that enchants visitors from all corners of the globe.&#xA0; This evening, you will participate in an awesome experience -- Petra by night in the light of 1,800 candles!&#xA0; Walk through the narrow canyon, known as the Siq, to the Khazneh following a candlelit path while you hear the enchanting and haunting music of the Bedouins.&#xA0; This experience is only offered on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday nights.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Movenpick Resort Petra (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Petra / Wadi Rum&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, return to explore this wondrous city of rock.&#xA0; Much of Petra's appeal comes from its spectacular setting deep inside a narrow desert gorge. &#xA0;You walk through the Siq again in daylight for a different perspective on the immense crack in the sandstone as it winds for one kilometer between overhanging cliffs.&#xA0; Petra's most famous monument, the Treasury, appears dramatically at the end of the Siq.&#xA0; While this is likely the most photographs image in Petra, there are many different walks and climbs that reveal the hundreds of buildings, facades, tombs, baths, funerary halls and temples that make up the site as well as a 3,000-seat theater from the 1st Century AD.&#xA0; This afternoon, you are in for a very special adventure as you journey to Wadi Rum, probably best known for its connection with the enigmatic British officer T.E. Lawrence.&#xA0; He was based here during the Great Arab Revolt of 1917-18, and he famously described it as "vast, echoing and God-like."&#xA0; It is truly a stunning desert landscape.&#xA0; Wadi Rum is a nature-lover's paradise. &#xA0;Explore the vast beauty of Wadi Rum on 4x4 vehicle tour that takes you deep into the heart of the desert.&#xA0; There are many areas that are secluded that you can visit on a camel or by mountain bike.&#xA0; Wadi Rum is also home to several Bedouin tribes who live in scattered camps throughout the area.&#xA0; The main route to Wadi Rum, and the small village of Rum, branches east off the Desert Highway about five kilometers south of Quweira and 25 kilometers north of Aqaba.&#xA0; From there, the road extends about 35 kilometers through the desert to end at Rum. &#xA0;The village is home to several hundred Bedouins with their goat-hair tents and concrete houses, a school, and a few shops.&#xA0; It is also the headquarters of the famous Desert Patrol.&#xA0; The desert tribes, Huweitat and Mzanah, inhabiting Wadi Rum maintain the warm hospitality which characterizes genuine Arab culture.&#xA0; It is difficult to resist their friendly invitation to share mint tea or cardamom-flavored coffee in their black tents.&#xA0; Tonight you will overnight Bedouin Camp!&#xA0; You have a deluxe, nicely decorated tent with private bathroom.&#xA0; There is another bigger tent that serves as the dining room.&#xA0; Enjoy the hospitality of the Bedouins as you sit by the fire under a starry desert sky.&#xA0; Enjoy traditional Arabian entertainment this evening.&#xA0; The night will be an unforgettable experience.&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Bedouin Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: &#xA0;Wadi Rum / Dead Sea&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Drive to Dead Sea.&#xA0; Visit Bethany beyond the Jordan, the site where John the Baptist baptized Jesus.&#xA0; The Bethany area sites formed part of the early Christian pilgrimage route between Jerusalem, the Jordan River, and Mt. Nebo.&#xA0; The area is also associated with the biblical account of how the Prophet Elijah (Mar Elias in Arabic) ascended to heaven in a whirlwind on a chariot of fire, after having parted the waters of the Jordan River and walked across it with his anointed successor the Prophet Elisha.&#xA0; Then you continue to your Dead Sea resort.&#xA0; You are welcomed to enjoy 30-minute massage compliments of Big Five.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Kempinski Dead Sea Resort &amp;amp; Hotel (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Dead Sea&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today you have the day for relaxation and enjoying the amenities at your hotel.&#xA0; The therapeutic benefits of the Dead Sea have been known to man for at least 2,000 years. &#xA0;Many people have found its unique combination of climatic conditions and natural elements to be beneficial.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Kempinski Dead Sea Resort &amp;amp; Hotel (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Dead Sea / Amman / Depart&#xD;

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Lima, Peru&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Peru!&#xA0; Upon arrival in Lima, a representative from Big Five will be greet you and escort you to your hotel, located conveniently at the airport.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Costa Del Sol Ramada&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Lima / Cusco / Sacred Vally of the Incas&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you fly to Cusco, at an elevation of approximately 11,400 feet.&#xA0; Your private guide will be waiting to take you to the village of Chinchero, among the loveliest in the Peruvian highlands and in the Sacred Valley of the Incas. &#xA0;Located in a high valley, this Andean village dates from before the Spanish conquest, and was once the country estate of a 15th-century Inca ruler.&#xA0; Encircled by lush farming terraces, the houses are built on the foundations of Inca buildings, including the remains of a palace.&#xA0; The 17th-century church has lovely frescoes and mural paintings.&#xA0; Visit the authentic market, alive with color and a cacophony of sounds.&#xA0; Chinchero's market is held in the shadow of the church within the central plaza, and is one of the best places in the entire valley to find Andean textiles.&#xA0; This afternoon, continue to Ollantaytambo &#x2013; another beautiful and tranquil village.&#xA0; Here are some spectacular and extensive Inca ruins, most enclosed within a temple fortress.&#xA0; The unfinished temple contains some of the largest stones ever used by the Inca builders.&#xA0; Spend the next two nights are at Willka T&#x2019;ika, &#x2018;sacred flower&#x2019; in Quechua, the language of the Andean people.&#xA0; This property is unique in that it was established as a garden retreat.&#xA0; The gardens are laid out as &#x2018;Seven Sacred Gardens.&#x2019;&#xA0; Each is dedicated to a different energy center, or chakra, to encourage personal meditation, healing and rejuvenation. &#xA0;The house, intricately merged with the gardens, was constructed in colonial style using local materials.&#xA0; There is also a large sunlit studio, designed for yoga, but also used for any practice including concerts with local musicians and dance groups.&#xA0; This evening, you will enjoy an introduction to the old Andean cultures.&#xA0; From their perspective, their culture and the world around them are not separate.&#xA0; They are intricately interwoven and nurture life as a whole.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt; Willka Tika House (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Sacred Valley of the Incas&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Begin today with a visit off the beaten path to Moray. &#xA0;You won't bump into too many tourists here.&#xA0; The Moray amphitheater is a series of circular terraces worked into the ground.&#xA0; Local people refer to it as the greenhouse of the Incas.&#xA0; Historians believe it was an agricultural research center.&#xA0; As you descend each layer, so too does the temperature.&#xA0; The Incas used Moray to test and develop new crops.&#xA0; Not only will you visit the agricultural fields, you may also participate or observe an old Inca ritual with an Andean healer. &#xA0;The ancient salt mines of Maras, nestled in amongst the green fields of the Sacred Valley, is a huge white area of&#xA0; terraces where salt has been collected for centuries.&#xA0; You can wander in between the salt-pans and watch the locals gathering salt just as workers have done for hundreds of years.&#xA0; Return your hotel for lunch.&#xA0; The afternoon is at leisure to use the yoga facilities, and sacred gardens and meditation areas. &#xA0;There are also outdoor solar baths, massages, and a Crystal bed available at an extra charge.&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0; Willka Tika House (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Important Note:&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;This evening you will need to pack a small bag for your rail journey tomorrow.&#xA0; For all Perurail journeys, each passenger is allowed 1 bag or backpack which must not exceed 05kg/11pounds and/or 62 inches/157cm (length + height + width).&#xA0; Please pack light.&#xA0; Baggage that exceeds these measurements will not be allowed.&#xA0; Your additional luggage will be stored by your Big Five representative.&lt;/em&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Sacred Valley of the Incas / Machu Picchu&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Travel to Willoq, a small Andean village that is, like so many places around the globe, struggling to balance old-world traditions with modern realities.&#xA0; Willoq dates back to the 1500s, when people fled into the mountains to escape the Spanish conquistadors.&#xA0; It remains a quiet village not on any tourist&#x2019;s maps.&#xA0; Here you mingle with the descendants of Incas, visit some of their stones and thatched roof houses, and see the unique textiles woven by the women of the village.&#xA0; After lunch by a stream, you will be transferred to Ollanta Station to board the Vista Valle train to Machu Picchu, a highlight of any trip to the Andes.&#xA0; The scenery is simply spectacular as this hour-and-a-half journey takes you through changing mountain vistas.&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0;&#xA0;Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Machu Picchu&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Early this morning, small buses take you to the entrance of the ruins in time for sunrise.&#xA0; Even if it is misty and cloudy, it is still an exquisite experience.&#xA0; Machu Picchu rises to an altitude of 7,900 feet above sea level.&#xA0; The fortress sits&#xA0;between the Huayna Picchu (young peak) and Machu Picchu (old peak).&#xA0; It lies within a spectacular framework of exuberant jungle vegetation and the beautifully rugged landscape.&#xA0; The ruins are situated in two different areas:&#xA0; the agricultural and the urban.&#xA0; The latter includes the civil sector (dwellings, canalizations), and the sacred sector (temples, mausoleums, squares, royal houses).&#xA0; Although constructions show different levels of architecture, religious buildings exhibit a high degree of perfection. &#xA0;The construction was with general use of stone, and the roofs were built of tree trunks and thatched with ichu straw.&#xA0; The walls were made with an inward inclination for protection against earthquakes.&#xA0; You have the entire day to explore the ruins with your private guide.&#xA0; When you are ready to return to your hotel, you will take the bus back to the town of Aguas Calientes and then walk to your accommodations.&#xA0; Although Machu Picchu is your main focus, Inkaterra Machu Picchu can be used as a quiet retreat for the mind and body or a base for numerous excursions.&#xA0; On the hotel grounds, nature trails wind past waterfalls and gardens; trained guides explain the fascinating cloud forest ecosystem. &#xA0;Discover a working tea plantation, and the world&#x2019;s largest private collection of indigenous orchids.&#xA0; What could be more enchanting than the vibrant Waqnaki orchid with its legend of a lovesick Inca princess whose sadness was transformed into colorful teardrop petals?&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0; Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Machu Picchu / Cusco&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, return via Vistadome Valley train to the Ollanta Station.&#xA0; On your way back to Cusco, you will stop to visit the archaeological sites that surround Cusco:&#xA0; the Saqsayhuaman Fortress, an amazing site with huge stone constructions.&#xA0; The site is said to have a great cosmic energy, which is why many people think it was an astronomic observatory and an Inca oracle.&#xA0; Also visit Q&#x2019;enqo, a place that was used for worship and ceremonial center.&#xA0; Then continue to your hotel for check in and lunch.&#xA0; This afternoon begin your sightseeing of Cusco.&#xA0; The curved stonework of the Temple of the Sun (Koricancha) is probably unequalled in the world. Colonial treasures include mansions and churches (the Cathedral, La Merced Convent, La Compania), built on Inca foundations.&#xA0; Churches house marvelous works from the Cusco School of painting, distinguished by its mix of Catholic and pagan imagery.&#xA0; Stroll the high, narrow streets of &#x201C;San Blas&#x201D;, the artisans&#x2019; neighborhood, where artists create pieces using wool, clay and stone.&#xA0; Continue to the famous Twelve Angles stone, part of the largest Inca wall in Cusco, which used to be the Hatunrumiyoc (Big Stone) palace, and demonstrates the Inca skill with polygonal masonry.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0;Monasterio Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Cusco&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Early this morning, set out to Anta Valley (northeast from Cusco City).&#xA0; After approximately an hour drive, arrive to the lesser known archaeological complex of Killarumiyoc, consisting of huge Inca remains including farming terraces, water channels and enormous walls built in the same way as Saqsaywaman in Cusco.&#xA0; Encounter the most important site &#x2013; the representation of the Moon Calendar carved in limestone.&#xA0;&#xA0;Mama Kill, Mother Moon, is one of the most important Incan deities, and was the sister and wife of the Sun.&#xA0; The Incas built temples to worship the Moon and the main altar was the Moon Calendar.&#xA0; Continue to Zurite archaeological complex where you will find gigantic Inca-built terraces, perhaps some of the largest in the world.&#xA0; Tumibamba is another Inca temple built in the shape of a ceremonial knife.&#xA0; The temple was hidden by Inca in order to save it from destruction by the Spanish conquest.&#xA0; Enjoy a picnic lunch with great views of the Anta Valley and the Andes. &#xA0;This afternoon, visit the colonial town of Huarocondo, where you will walk the old colonial streets and the main plaza and meet local people.&#xA0; Late afternoon, you return to your Cusco hotel.&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0; Monasterio Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; Cusco&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;The San Pedro local market is a wonderful place to encounter the everyday life of Cusco before you drive to Tipon, an Incan archaeological site with it well-known Temple of the Water.&#xA0; Its impressive agricultural terraces, sacred fountains and aqueducts are still in use.&#xA0; This 500-acre, self-contained walled settlement served as an estate for Inca nobility.&#xA0; It was nominated recently by the American Society of Civil Engineers as a &#x201C;Water Engineering Masterpiece of the Inca Empire.&#x201D;&#xA0; Tip&#xF3;n has been farmed and partially irrigated for more than 450 years, and reveals the Inca to be masters of irrigation and hydraulic technology.&#xA0; They designed buildings, waterworks, and massive structures to be visually and functionally in harmony with the natural environment.&#xA0; Your guide will take you on a tour of Tipon&#xB4;s canals, plazas, aqueducts and fountains &#x2013;infrastructure that transformed a remote mountainside into a true engineering marvel.&#xA0; While here you will have the chance to participate or observe an Andean ceremony with a native healer.&#xA0; Afterwards enjoy lunch before returning to Cusco and your hotel.&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0; Monasterio Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; Cusco&#xA0;/ Lima / Depart&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Transfer to the airport for your return flight to Lima.&#xA0; Upon arrival, you are met and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; Your room is available for day use. &#xA0;Lima, the center of Spanish power in the New World for three centuries, is the focal point that draws the country into one land.&#xA0; The capital enjoys a considerable legacy of art and architecture from its colonial period, while its museums are bursting with artifacts of gold, ceramic and weavings unearthed from the country's ancient settlements.&#xA0; Your half-day sightseeing program will include Lima&#x2019;s superb colonial churches, palaces and promenades.&#xA0; You will then continue to the Larco Herrera Museum, with its collection of pottery, gold and silver works, and mummies.&#xA0; Its collection of erotic ceramics from the Chimu, Mohica and other Pre-Inca civilizations is of unusual interest and is the only pottery collection of its kind in the world.&#xA0; After dinner, transfer to airport for your homebound flight.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Miraflores Park Hotel &#x2013; Day Use Room (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Tel&#xA0;Aviv / Caesarea / Megiddo / Haifa / Tiberias&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
You will start the day with a visit to the Roman port of Caesarea, built by King Herod. &#xA0;&#x201C;Queen of the Coast,&#x201D;&#xA0; Herod&#x2019;s showcase city features amphitheater, theater; Byzantine walls, the &#x201C;bird mosaic,&#x201D; the Crusader city,&#xA0; aqueduct and more.&#xA0; Continue on to the ancient Solomonic city of Megiddo, exploring the ancient city, the Early Bronze Age temples and the city&#x2019;s amazing water system.&#xA0; Arrive in Haifa atop Mount Carmel to investigate the Reuben and Edith Hecht Museum at Haifa University.&#xA0; This fine museum exhibits an outstanding collection of Phoenician artifacts. &#xA0;You also have the opportunity to visit one of the most amazing hanging gardens in the world, the Bahai Center Persian Gardens before you drive east towards the Sea of Galilee.&#xA0; Along the way, stop in Zippori,&#xA0; one of the most beautiful archeological sites in Israel where you will encounter the Mona Lisa of the Galilee.&#xA0; This exquisite and well-preserved mosaic, unearthed inside a building referred to as the Roman villa, received the nickname because she seems to have the same quality of timelessness and of superb artistry.&#xA0; Arrive in Tiberias and check in to your deluxe hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The&#xA0;Scots Hotel &#x2013; Antique Lake View Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: &#xA0;Tiberias / Capernaum / Beit Shean / Jerusalem&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;The first stop this morning is Capernaum, the site of Jesus&#x2019; three-year ministry.&#xA0; Visit the ruins of the 4th-century synagogue believed to be the house of St. Peter.&#xA0; Continue to Belvoir, one of the nicest castles built by the crusaders in the 12th century during crusades to the Holy Land. &#xA0;It has a great view of the Jordan River and beyond to the Kingdom of Jordan.&#xA0; Then, you are off to Beit Shean, one of the most outstanding, yet often overlooked, excavation sites in the Middle East.&#xA0; The city was important historically due to its geographical location at the junction of the Jordan River Valley and Jezreel Valley.&#xA0; There are many mounds in the valley, which contain cities from the past lying buried in them.&#xA0; Beit Shean is probably the most important of these. &#xA0;Tel Beit Shean, a part of the National Park on the site, contains 15 subsequent occupation layers &#x2013; meaning that 15 cities jumbled on top of each other!&#xA0; You will visit the theater, the Cardo, the Hot Bath and more.&#xA0; On the road to Jerusalem, you will stop at the inn of the Good Samaritan to visit a small new museum showing wonderful mosaic floors found in excavations in the area.&#xA0; These sites are well off the beaten track for most visitors to Israel.&#xA0; Upon arrival in Jerusalem,&#xA0; go up the Mount of Olives for an amazing view of the entire old city of Jerusalem, Mount Moria and the golden dome Muslim shrine &#x2013; the Dome of the Rock.&#xA0; These views will give you a clearer understanding of Jerusalem&#x2019;s geographical position and will help you get the proper orientation for tomorrow&#x2019;s city tour.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The King David Jerusalem Hotel &#x2013; Executive Old City Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Jerusalem&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Begin the day with a visit to the old city, entering the walled city via the Zion gate and the Jewish quarter.&#xA0; Here you will visit the Roman Cardo, the &#x201C;Broad wall,&#x201D; the Herodian quarter, the basement of a Jerusalem home revealing dramatic evidence of the history of one family, the Katros, who probably lived and worked here, and of Jerusalem&#x2019;s destruction in 70 CE.&#xA0; You then arrive at the Western wall, the only relic from the great Temple and the most sacred site for the Jewish people.&#xA0;&#xA0;Here, by special appointment, you will visit the Western Wall tunnels, also known as the Rabbinical Tunnels, one of the most exciting Archeological sites. During the visit you will see the foundation of the great temple built by King Herod. &#xA0;You will also see the original Western Wall as you walk along 1,445 feet of the original, enormous 2,000-year-old Herodian stones, seeing the lofty Warren&#x2019;s Gate, a street and other finds.&#xA0; You will then explore more of the old city such as the pools of Bethesda, the Via Dolorosa, The Church of the Holy Sepulcher &#x2013; most of the complex over the sacred ground marking the tomb of Jesus is a complicated combination of medieval and Byzantine architecture.&#xA0; Deep below the surface are remains going back to a First Temple-era stone quarry and the world-famous and rarely viewed &#x201C;ship inscription,&#x201D;&#xA0; probably carved by a long-ago pilgrim.&#xA0; You will have time to walk and explore the colorful Arab Bazaar.&#xA0; You end the tour at the Jaffa gate where you will visit the Tower of David Museum inside the rooms of Jerusalem&#x2019;s Turkish (Ottoman) citadel.&#xA0; Each of the many rooms features exhibits devoted to a different time-period, clarifying the capital&#x2019;s complex history.&#xA0; Next is one of the highlights of your Jerusalem tour.&#xA0; Explore&#xA0;the city&#x2019;s historical layers at the City of David, King David&#x2019;s &#x201C;fortress of Zion,&#x201D; where Biblical Jerusalem was established 3,000 years ago.&#xA0;&#xA0;The ongoing excavations include a royal palace, the &#x201C;water fortress&#x201D; of the Gihon (1 Kings 1:33), the Second Temple-era Pool of Siloam (John 9:7) and a 2,000-year-old street that once led up to the Temple.&#xA0; Here you will meet one of the project Archeologists who will give you a private tour during which you will be allowed to visit ongoing excavation areas which are still closed to the public.&#xA0; The excavations have exposed the city and shaft leading from the city to the water supply in the Kidron Valley. &#xA0;You will examine Hezekiah&#x2019;s Tunnel,&#xA0; built by King Hezekiah 3000 years ago,&#xA0; which was built through the rock under the city to divert the water into an inner city reservoir, the Gihon Spring and Pool of Siloam.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The King David Jerusalem Hotel &#x2013; Executive Old City Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Jerusalem&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Your first stop this morning is the Model of Jerusalem at the time of the Second Temple (2000 years ago).&#xA0; The remainder of the morning is devoted to your visit at the Israel Museum, which houses the Dead Sea Scrolls and many other treasures, and the Billy Rose sculpture gardens.&#xA0; Here by special appointment you will have a private meeting with the Museum&#x2019;s curator who will tell you about their unique work and the Museum Laboratories.&#xA0; Later you will be driven to Mount Scopus and have a chance to participate in a special archaeological project, the "Screening and sifting the Temple Mount Waste project&#x201D;.&#xA0; This project, under the supervision of Dr. Gabi Barkai and Tzachi Schwieg of Bar Ilan University, is designed to discover archaeological remains that were in the Temple Mount and were thrown out by the Muslim Waqf during digging there in 1999.&#xA0; In the course of the sifting project thousands of items from all periods have been discovered including fragments of stone decorated with ornaments known to be from the Second Temple Period such as arrowheads from Nebuchadnezzar's army and from the Romans as well as coins and decorations from all the periods.&#xA0; Among the most exciting finds were bullae (seal rings), written in ancient Hebrew.&#xA0; You will end the day with a visit to another very important archeological site &#x2013; the Davidson Center and the southern wall excavations site.&#xA0; Here you will learn about the great Temple based on the findings in the excavations that took place here during the last 30 years.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The King David Jerusalem Hotel &#x2013; Executive Old City Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Jerusalem / Tel Maresha / Herodion / Bethlehem / Jerusalem&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today, drive south to the Hellenistic city of Biet Guvrin / Tel Maresha where you will meet with the archeologist in charge.&#xA0; He will give you a short background talk on the site and then you will get your buckets and shovels and dig-in!&#xA0; After an hour or so, you will then visit the site, an enormous underground city. &#xA0;From here you will drive to Herodion, a cone shape mountain south of Jerusalem built as a fortress by King Herod.&#xA0; After a 30 year quest, archeologist Ehud Netzer recently found the royal tomb of King Herod on the slope of Herodion. &#xA0;Travel to Bethlehem, the birth place of Jesus, to the ancient Byzantine church built over the manger.&#xA0; Return to Jerusalem.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The King David Jerusalem Hotel &#x2013; Executive Old City Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Jerusalem / Dead Sea / Masada / Aqaba, Jordan&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This special day begins with an early drive through the Judean Wilderness.&#xA0; Your first stop will be to Qumran, believed to have been an Essene settlement whose library housed the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in nearby caves.&#xA0; Next you will ascent to the great fortress of Masada. Built by Herod as a sanctuary, it was later occupied by the Zealots and others fleeing the Romans.&#xA0; From the summit of Masada, you view the southern part of the Dead Sea and the mountains of Moab on the east.&#xA0; After lunch (and swim or float at the Dead Sea waters), you journey south to the border crossing between Israel and Jordan near the shores of the Red Sea and the cities of Eilat and Aqaba.&#xA0; After crossing the border, you will be met by your Jordanian guide and driven to Aqaba and your hotel for dinner and overnight.&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kempinski Aqaba Hotel &#x2013; Superior Room (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; Aqaba / Wadi Rum / Petra&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, you will be driven to Wadi Rum, a timeless place where the winds have carved towering skyscrapers of rock and sand.&#xA0; The fabled T.E. Lawrence described this as as &#x201C;vast, echoing and god-like&#x2026;&#x201D;&#xA0; A maze of monolithic rockscapes rises up from the desert floor to heights of 1,750 meters creating a natural challenge for serious mountaineers.&#xA0; Your first visit is Jebel Kharaz, a graceful arch, located about 40 kms from the village of Rum. &#xA0;Traditionally the Bedouin of this area have used the arch as a shelter in bad weather, and nowadays it is more than likely that you would see them still there, offering tea or coffee, or even a camel ride!&#xA0; People before the Bedouin obviously found the arch a useful shelter and meeting place, and around Jebel Kharaz there are a number of signs of the Nabatean people.&#xA0; There are some very clear Thamudic-style drawings as well as 4,000-year-old rock drawings.&#xA0;&#xA0;Then onto Petra, one of Jordan's and the indeed the world&#x2019;s treasures.&#xA0; Petra is the legacy of the Nabateans, an industrious Arab people who settled in southern Jordan more than 2,000 years ago, with some of the most famous buildings carved out of sandstone rock cliffs along a narrow canyon.&#xA0; Admired then for its refined culture, massive architecture and ingenious complex of dams and water channels, Petra is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site that enchants visitors from all corners of the globe.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Movenpick Resort Petra &#x2013; Standard Room (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; Petra / Amman&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
You will spend the morning exploring Petra.&#xA0; Although much has been written about Petra, nothing really prepares you for this amazing place.&#xA0; Often described as the eighth wonder of the ancient world, it is a vast, unique city, carved into the sheer rock face with the entrance to the city through the Siq, a narrow gorge over 1 kilometer in length, which is flanked on either side by soaring, 80 meters high cliffs. &#xA0;Just walking through the Siq is an experience in itself.&#xA0; The colors and formations of the rocks are dazzling.&#xA0; As you reach the end of the Siq you will catch your first glimpse of Al-Khazneh (Treasury).&#xA0; A massive fa&#xE7;ade, 30 meters wide and 43 meters high, carved out of the sheer, dusky pink, rock-face and dwarfing everything around it.&#xA0; It was carved in the early 1st century as the tomb of an important Nabataean king and represents the engineering genius of these ancient people.&#xA0; You will then drive along the Desert Highway north to Amman and your hotel for dinner and overnight.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Hotel Amman &#x2013; Deluxe Room (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10:&#xA0; Amman &#x2013; Madaba &#x2013; Tal Jalloul &#x2013; Mt Nebo - Amman&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you will drive to Madaba, best known for reaching its height during the Byzantine Period when it was the seat of the archbishop.&#xA0; Many famous mosaics are from this period.&#xA0; At the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George, you view the earliest surviving original map of Holyland, a 6th century mosaic map of Palestine. &#xA0;Containing a great number of details, it also includes a depiction of the fauna and flora in the different regions.&#xA0; Travel to Tal Jallol, which has a newly excavated site of an Iron Age city located on the top of an artificial hill.&#xA0; The excavations showed that the site was inhabited during the Ammonite period as it was on the cross road of a caravan routes.&#xA0; Mount Nebo - Moses' mountain as mentioned in the New Testament, is believed to be where Moses died after wandering with his people through the desert for forty years.&#xA0; At the top of the mountain, you get a grand view of the Dead Sea. &#xA0;In favorable weather, you can see as far as Jerusalem.&#xA0; In the church are several lovely mosaics from the 6th century.&#xA0; Your last stop of the day is a visit at Bethany Beyond the Jordan, site of John the Baptist's settlement and where Jesus was baptized.&#xA0; It has long been known from the Bible (John 1:28 and 10:40) and from the Byzantine and medieval texts.&#xA0; The site has now been identified on the east bank of the Jordan River, in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. &#xA0;The&#xA0; area formed part of the early Christian pilgrimage route between Jerusalem, the Jordan River, and Mount Nebo.&#xA0; The area is also associated with the biblical account of how the Prophet Elijah (Mar Elias in Arabic) ascended to heaven in a whirlwind on a chariot of fire.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Hotel Amman &#x2013; Deluxe Room (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;&#x201C;I am from Chiclayo, Peru so Peru is at the heart of everything that inspires me.&#xA0; This journey is one I want to share with my husband and especially my son.&#xA0; I want him to know the cultures and traditions of Peru. &#xA0;This is a great vacation for families.&#xA0; It has something for everyone &#x2013;&#xA0; family-friendly museums, white water rafting, a picnic in the Andes, the chance to see the magnificent Andean condor, a preserve for llamas, vicunas and alpacas, and a train journey through the mountains to one of the world&#x2019;s most dramatic&#xA0;archaeological sites&#x2026;Machu Picchu.&#xA0; Peru has so much to offer.&#x201D;&#xA0; Gisela Polo, Destination Specialist&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Experience a classic train journey through the Andes to discover one of South America&#x2019;s most remarkable archaeological sites &#x2013; the ancient Andean fortress of Machu Picchu, the &#x201C;Lost City of the Incas&#x201D;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Arequipa / Cusco &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/ Sacred Valley&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning you will be transferred to the airport where you will check in to your scheduled flight to Cusco. Upon arrival in Cusco you will be met and transferred to Sacred Valley, stopping at Hatuncancha, an incredible spot by the shores of a crystalline stream flowing in the Paramo, a unique mountain habitat where condors glide on updrafts and llamas and alpacas graze on its prairies. This tranquil place is home to one of the most authentic Quechua-speaking families you will ever meet. They will welcome you into your home (Cancha), which has stood in the exact spot since the Incas rules the area. You will enjoy their hospitality and learn about their ancient way of life. Today&#x2019;s journey takes you back in time, 800 years into the past!&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Hotel Sol Y Luna &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; Sacred Valley&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you set out on a rafting adventure on the Urubamba River.&#xA0; Following a safety briefing, you enjoy a two-hour river run, riding through what are usually Class 3 and 4 rapids (Water levels are subject to seasonal variations. &#xA0;The minimum age for rafting is 8).&#xA0; The river starts gently, building up to rapids through a beautiful section of the canyon.&#xA0; Enjoy a typical &#x201C;pachamanca,&#x201D; a technique for cooking in the earth. &#xA0;Used around the globe, the technique is infinitely variable.&#xA0; In Peru, hot rocks are used instead of smoldering coals.&#xA0; As in many cultures, cooking in this manner is a communal affair, and everyone gets involved.&#xA0; After lunch, tour the village of Ollantaytambo, which has extensive Inca ruins, most enclosed within a temple fortress.&#xA0; The unfinished temple contains some of the largest stones ever used by Inca builders.&#xA0; The village itself is constructed on top of Inca foundations.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Hotel Sol Y Luna&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0;&#xA0;Sacred Valley&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Depart by vehicle this morning to Moray.&#xA0; Your guide takes you down into these ruins.&#xA0; The ancient agricultural terraces of circular and concentric shape were built by the Incas and thought to be used as a seed-producing area for the main crops of the empire:&#xA0; maize and potato.&#xA0; You stroll along a mostly flat path to the town of Maras through farmlands with views of the surrounding mountains.&#xA0;&#xA0;On the way to the salt pans, you pause for a picnic lunch before continuing on to the salt pans.&#xA0; Your guide explains how the salt-draining process works.&#xA0; Walk down into the Sacred Valley.&#xA0; You may spot a Cara Cara, a member of the falcon family, Andean gulls or hummingbirds. &#xA0;The path, which runs alongside a gorge, takes you down to the Urubamba River.&#xA0; On one side of the path is the brook that runs through the salt pans.&#xA0; Cross the hanging bridge, and board a van that takes you back to the hotel.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Hotel Sol Y Luna &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Important Note:&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;This evening you will need to pack a small bag for your rail journey tomorrow.&#xA0; For all Perurail journeys, each passenger is allowed 1 bag or backpack, which must not exceed 05kg/11pounds and/or 62 inches/157cm (length + height + width).&#xA0; Please pack light.&#xA0; Baggage that exceeds these measurements will not be allowed.&#xA0; Your additional luggage will be stored by your Big Five representative.&lt;/em&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10:&#xA0; Urubamba / Poroy / Machu Picchu&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you are escorted to the Poroy Station to board the Hiram Bingham train to Machu Picchu.&#xA0; The train journey is a highlight of any trip to the Andes.&#xA0; Enjoy brunch as stunning scenery unfolds before you through the large picture windows.&#xA0; The three-and-a-half-hour journey takes you through the Sacred Valley, past lush green fields and colorful villages in the foothills of the Andes.&#xA0; Arrive at the train station in Aguas Calientes, where you and your private guide board small buses for the short ride to the entrance of the ruins.&#xA0; Machu Picchu is nestled between the Huayna Picchu (young peak) and Machu Picchu (old peak), at an altitude of 7,900 feet above sea level.&#xA0;&#xA0;In this rugged landscape, the fortress is situated on the eastern slope of Machu Picchu in two different areas: the agricultural and the urban.&#xA0; The latter includes the civil sector (dwellings, canalizations), and the sacred sector (temples, mausoleums, squares, royal houses).&#xA0; Although constructions show different levels of architecture, religious buildings exhibit a high degree of perfection.&#xA0; The construction used stone, with roofs of trees trunks and thatched with ichu straw.&#xA0; The walls have an inward inclination to protection against earthquakes. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Inkaterra Machu Picchu Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11:&#xA0; Machu Picchu / Poroy / Cusco&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you are free to explore the Machu Picchu area with a private guide at your disposal.&#xA0; Experiencing the ruins at sunrise should not be missed; even if it is misty and cloudy, early morning on this sacred site is an amazing experience.&#xA0; For a truly mystical experience, those who like to hike can go up Huayna Picchu peak, opposite Machu Picchu, for imposing, panoramic views.&#xA0; The breathtaking views of this mountain-top citadel are a photographer&#x2019;s dream.&#xA0; You can also walk along to the Sun Gate, which is the last section of the famous Inca Trail.&#xA0; Late this afternoon, you return to Cusco via the Hiram Bingham.&#xA0; On board, savor pre-dinner cocktails and live entertainment in the bar before settling down to a four-course dinner.&#xA0; Upon arrival in Poroy station, you are met and privately transferred to your historic hotel in the heart of Cusco.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Monasterio (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 12:&#xA0; Cusco&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;High in the Andes, about 11,400 feet above sea level, Cusco is considered the oldest continuously inhabited city in the Western Hemisphere. Founded in the 15th century by the Incas, it was later conquered by Spain. Much of the city&#x2019;s architecture reflects the dramatic Spanish style known as Cusco Baroque. The Incas conceived their capital in the shape of a Puma with the river serving as the spine with Sacsayhuaman as the head and the main city center as the body. Almost every central street has remains of Inca walls, arches and doorways. Many streets are lined with Inca stonework that serves as foundations for more modern buildings. Inca stonework is tapered upwards (battered), and every wall has a perfect line of inclination towards the center, from bottom to top. Churches display many of the marvelous works from the Cusco School of painting, which is distinguished by its eccentric mix of Catholic and pagan imagery. Enjoy a half-day exploration of this magical city as you drive the main streets, and visit the Sun Temple, now the Santo Domingo Church. The curved stonework of the temple is probably unequalled in the world. During the Inca period, the stones were layered with gold. Then, visit the archaeological sites that surround Cusco, including Saqsayhuaman Fortress, with its huge stone constructions. Many people believe the site has great cosmic energy, and may have been an astronomic observatory and the site of an ancient Inca oracle. Also visit Q&#x2019;enqo, used for worship and as a ceremonial center. In the city, stop by the San Pedro local market, where you pause to watch the everyday life of the people of Cusco. Visit &#x201C;San Blas,&#x201D; the Artisans&#x2019; Neighborhood of high, narrow streets, a beautiful little plaza, where textiles, clay and the wood are turned into art pieces. The famous Twelve Angles stone is part of the largest Inca wall in Cusco, and used to be the Hatunrumiyoc (Big Stone) palace, a fine example of Inca skill with polygonal masonry.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Monasterio &lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: Cusco / Lima / Depart&lt;/strong&gt; Transfer to the airport for your return flight to Lima. Upon arrival, you are met and transferred to your hotel where you have a day room for your convenience. The remainder of the day is at leisure. This evening, transfer to the airport for your flight out. &lt;strong&gt;Country Club Hotel(B) &lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

    <tour_name>Zambia &amp; Botswana: Uncharted Footsteps</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;&#x201C;When I was asked to create an itinerary for this collection, my mind went immediately to Zambia and Botswana. You do have limited opportunity to ride quad bikes at one of the camps, but I am passionate about journeys that you take on foot.&#xA0; It is such an entirely different experience than you have using even the most eco-sensitive safari vehicle.&#xA0; Your entire focus changes when you are on the ground, face to face with the African bushveld, since what you see depends entirely on how far you are willing to go. I admit that I want to have my cake and eat it, too, so this itinerary features wonderfully comfortable camps each night. I think this is as close to the fabled safaris of old as you can have today.&#xA0; And, it is the essence of sustainable travel &#x2013; leave nothing behind but your footprints.&#x201D;&#xA0; Ashish Sanghrajka, President&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;Discover the richly varied habitats of Zambia&#x2019;s South Luangwa National Park, one of Africa's premier wildlife sanctuaries at the southern tip of the Great Rift Valley.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;Venture out on a 2-day walking mobile safari in a remote section of the park, which has become known as the wilderness experience of the South Luangwa, where walking safaris were pioneered and perfected.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;The Makgadikgadi Salt Pans Kalahari and an insight into the traditions and culture of the nomadic Bushmen.&#xA0; Mornings spent viewing the meerkats, visiting the majestic baobab trees used as camp sites by Livingstone. &#xA0;Walks with Bushman trackers are also on offer. &#xA0;With them you learn about survival and tracking techniques and perhaps observe the desert-adapted wildlife of gemsbok, suricate and rare brown hyena.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;Enjoy a private tour of Victoria Falls followed by a visit to Chief Mukuni's village.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;Discover the phenomenal beauty and energy of Victoria Falls during a private tour; and take an elephant-back safari that winds through riverine bush, across the Zambezi River onto islands.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Lusaka, Zambia / South Luangwa National Park&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
On arrival at Lusaka Airport, check-in for your scheduled air charter flight to Mfuwe on the edge of South Luangwa National Park.&#xA0; On arrival at Mfuwe Airport you will be collected by a representative from your lodge for your one hour road transfer to Nkwali Camp.&#xA0; Drive through villages, agricultural lands and bush.&#xA0; At the southern tip of the Great Rift Valley lies the South Luangwa National Park, one of Africa's premier wildlife sanctuaries.&#xA0; It's primeval forest and lush savanna stretch for hundreds of miles, encompassing the Luangwa River basin, its adjacent highlands and a mosaic of different habitats.&#xA0; The Luangwa River meanders through the luxuriant valley, supporting thousands of hippo and crocodile and sustaining the park.&#xA0; South Luangwa has one of the greatest game concentrations in Africa. &#xA0;Elephant, a wide variety of antelope, buffalo, kudu, zebra, Thornycroft's giraffe and wildebeest occur in great numbers, as well as over 400 bird species. &#xA0;Lion, wild dog and hyena are also common and the park is famed for its excellent leopard sightings.&#xA0; The Luangwa experience differs with the seasons.&#xA0; In the dry winter months from June to September you can stay at small seasonal safari camps in glorious seclusion.&#xA0; The more sophisticated lodges, close to the main gate at Mfuwe Bridge remain open longer.&#xA0; Many visitors spend a couple of nights in the south, where animals are used to vehicles before heading into the wilderness.&#xA0; Delightful camps occupy prime sites on ancient oxbow lakes, amidst shady ebony groves, and offer day and night game drives in open vehicles.&#xA0; The standard of guiding is exceptionally good - walking safaris were pioneered in Luangwa and it still sets the pace.&#xA0; Expert guides lead you through the bush, giving you the opportunity to observe the game at close quarters and gain fascinating insights into the ways of the wild.&#xA0; Nkwali Camp is built on private land overlooking the park on the banks of the Luangwa River.&#xA0; This small camp of six thatched en suite chalets has an unusual bar encircling an enormous ebony tree and a dining room overlooking the lagoon.&#xA0; Elephants can often be seen crossing the river from the bar, or come to the waterhole near the thatched dining room.&#xA0; The chalets are cool and spacious, overlooking the river, and have an en suite, semi-open bathroom with flush loo and double shower.&#xA0; The family suite offers two bedrooms both en suite, and the honeymoon suite has a separate sitting room.&#xA0; There's a small swimming pool.&#xA0; The camp is open all year round and access to the park for most of the season is by boat or pontoon.&#xA0; Activities include walking, day and night drives and visits to the local village and school of Kawaza.&#xA0; The area is famous for leopard and giraffe sightings.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt; Nkwali Camp &#x2013; Cottage (Full Board &amp;amp; Game Activities)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Important Note:&#xA0; The luggage allowance is strictly 15kg per person in soft squashable bags.&#xA0; Check-in for the flight is one hour prior to departure and the counters close 30 minutes prior to departure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: &#xA0;South&#xA0;Luangwa National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you head north to Tena Tena Camp.&#xA0; Enjoy some informal game viewing during the roughly 2&#xBD; hour drive. &#xA0;On arrival, enjoy lunch followed by some time to relax before the afternoon game drive.&#xA0; The camp boasts a stunning location on a remote wooded bend of the Luangwa River within the Nsefu Sector of the National Park. &#xA0;"Tena Tena &#x2026;is altogether beyond superlatives, and must be one of the best safari camps in the whole of Africa," stated The Times of London.&#xA0; A grove of mahogany trees shade the five large custom-made tents (under thatch) with en suite open air bathrooms.&#xA0; A honeymoon suite features a separate sitting and private dining area. &#xA0;From the dining room and bar guests can watch elephant, hippo and antelope on the river banks.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Tena Tena Camp &#x2013; Tent (Fully Inclusive)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; South&#xA0;Luangwa National Park&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Game viewing takes place either on foot or on day and night drives.&#xA0; Nearby, at a spectacular lagoon, you could easily spend the whole morning sitting quietly and watching the game come down to feed and drink.&#xA0; Being remote and so small, the camp&#x2019;s guests have these scenes to themselves. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Tena Tena Camp &#x2013; Tent (Fully Inclusive)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; South Luangwa National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After an early breakfast, head north to start your walking mobile safari, which has become known as THE wilderness experience of the South Luangwa.&#xA0; Your drive is through remote parts of the park.&#xA0; You arrive in camp for lunch around mid day.&#xA0; The camp is already set up for your arrival with well-equipped walk-in tents. &#xA0;The shower is under a tree and the toilet is a long drop.&#xA0; Enjoy a relaxing siesta after lunch, before tea and a walk around camp in the afternoon.&#xA0; Enjoy sundowners and dinner under the stars!&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Luangwa Bush Camping - Tent (Fully Inclusive)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; South&#xA0;Luangwa National Park&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Up at sunrise, you set out for the morning walk.&#xA0; The area is remote and wild, the terrain and habitats varied, and the game shy and unused to people.&#xA0; You will experience and learn about life in the bush, from ants to buffalo, from a bird&#x2019;s nest to tracking lion.&#xA0; The mobile camp is moved to the second camp site, and lunch is waiting for you when you arrive in late morning.&#xA0; After some time to rest, you take an afternoon walk.&#xA0; All walks are led by an experienced ranger and accompanied by an armed game scout. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Luangwa Bush Camping - Tent (Fully Inclusive)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;

Today is a chance to drive or walk through the ebony groves.&#xA0; Or you may decide this is an ideal day to explore the Nsefu Sector of the park, depending on season, possibly on extended day-long game drives. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Nsefu Camp &#x2013; Tent (Fully Inclusive)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; South Luangwa National Park / Livingstone&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning you will be transferred back to Mfuwe Airport for your scheduled charter flight to Lusaka, and then on to Livingstone.&#xA0; The luggage allowance is 15kg per person in soft squashable bags.&#xA0; The overall travel time is approx 3 hours depending on the aircraft utilized and the stopover time in Lusaka.&#xA0; On arrival at Livingstone airport, you are met and taken to a water taxi for the ride directly to the Royal Livingstone Hotel jetty, where staff are waiting for you.&#xA0; The Royal Livingstone Hotel is an elegant 5-star hotel in an unrivalled setting overlooking the Victoria Falls.&#xA0; The 173 rooms, with their hand-carved mahogany furniture, have an African feel with eastern overtones.&#xA0; All have a balcony or patio with views of the mature acacia trees, lawns and river.&#xA0; The hotel has a superb restaurant, large pool, pool bar and small casino.&#xA0; A splendid large wooden deck affords sweeping views of the falls, ideal for cocktails at sunset.&#xA0; As the hotel is actually in the Zambezi National Park, park fees are included so you can visit the falls as much as you would like during your stay.&#xA0; There are a range of excursions available including sunset boat cruises, local village tours, game drives, helicopter flips and various adventure options. &#xA0;Massages can either be enjoyed outside with a view over the river, or in the privacy of your room.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Royal Livingstone Hotel &#x2013; Luxury Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; Livingstone&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, you enjoy a private tour of Victoria Falls on a walk in the natural rainforest to the edge of the falls.&#xA0; A knowledgeable local guide accompanies you.&#xA0; The falls are one of the most spectacular natural sights in the world.&#xA0; Next, you head to Chief Mukuni's village, founded in the 13th century.&#xA0; It is home to the Leya people, who you meet.&#xA0; The village has a population of 7,000, a clinic, basic school and boreholes for drinking water.&#xA0; Visitors see how huts are built and decorated, meet residents and see the locals at work creating curios.&#xA0; Please realize this is a working village and not one built as an example for tourists, so it is an authentic glimpse of life in an African village today.&#xA0; You return to the hotel for lunch before enjoying an afternoon excursion to Livingstone Island.&#xA0; Livingstone Island lies perched right on the very edge of Victoria Falls in the midst of this thundering mass of water.&#xA0; Dr Livingstone first viewed the Mosi-oa-Tunya ('the Smoke That Thunders') from this island.&#xA0; He was paddled in a dugout canoe but today visitors are picked up from the Royal Livingstone jetty and a skilled skipper re-traces Livingstone's approach to the island (only during low water season, usually mid-July to the end of January).&#xA0; A guide leads you on a tour of the island, including its long history.&#xA0; In ancient times, this UNESCO World Heritage Site was used as a sacrificial site. &#xA0;You can take photos of the falls from this extraordinary angle, and the very intrepid can even take a heart-stopping peek over the island's edge to the churning mass below.&#xA0; After the tour, you can relax and enjoy afternoon tea with a view of the falls.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Royal Livingstone Hotel &#x2013; Luxury Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10: &#xA0;Livingstone&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Enjoy a full day on the Zambezi River, rafting with an experienced guide through some of the most exciting rapids in the world, and then drifting between rapids through breathtaking gorge scenery. &#xA0;Whitewater rafting on the Zambezi is divided into 'high water' and 'low water' seasons.&#xA0; Low whitewater rafting runs from about mid-July to the end of January, with the best months usually August and September.&#xA0; A full-day whitewater rafting trip includes 23 rapids with a stop for a picnic lunch of cold meats and salads.&#xA0; An advantage of the full-day rafting is that you don't have to climb out of the gorge at the end of the day; instead, you enjoy the new water lift at the end.&#xA0; (If you take the half day option you have to hike out.) &#xA0;The activity includes return transfers from your hotel to the meeting point at the Waterfront where you have breakfast and a safety talk prior to setting off on the river.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Royal Livingstone Hotel &#x2013; Luxury Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

En suite facilities offer indoor and outdoor showers and flush toilets.&#xA0; The tents are well spaced for privacy and each has a covered porch with an expansive view across the pans.&#xA0; Dining is in the mess tent, or al fresco under the stars, while the tea tent with cushions and a wind-up gramophone is ideal for afternoon tea.&#xA0; This stylish camp offers a traditional safari experience with a holistic understanding of Botswana's wildlife, geology, geography and its people, both past and present.&#xA0; In the dry winter months all-purpose ATV vehicles (quad-bikes) are available, allowing guests to visit the saltpans.&#xA0; (This activity takes place every third day so a three night stay is recommended.)&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Jack's Camp &#x2013; Standard Tent (Full Board &amp;amp; Activities)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 15:&#xA0; Johannesburg / Livingstone, Zambia&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today fly to Livingstone.&#xA0; Note: &#xA0;American passport holders need to obtain a visa on arrival for either US $50 per person in cash for a single entry or $80 double entry.&#xA0; Please request a double entry visa if you plan to visit the Victoria Falls from the Zimbabwe side also, otherwise a single entry visa is sufficient.&#xA0; Please ensure that you have the exact change in USD cash to settle these Visa fees.&#xA0; Credit cards are NOT accepted!&#xD;
&#xD;
On arrival, you are met by a local representative and privately transferred to the Jetty for your boat transfer to the hotel.&#xA0; The Royal Livingstone Hotel is an elegant five-star hotel in an unrivalled setting overlooking the falls.&#xA0; The 173 rooms, with their hand-carved mahogany furniture, have an African feel with eastern overtones.&#xA0; All have a balcony or patio with views of the mature acacia trees, lawns and river.&#xA0; The hotel has a superb restaurant, large pool, pool bar and small casino.&#xA0; A splendid large wooden deck affords sweeping views of the falls, ideal for cocktails at sunset.&#xA0; As the hotel is actually in the Zambezi National Park, park fees are included in the hotel's rates, so you can visit the falls as much as you like during your stay.&#xA0; Manicures and pedicures can be arranged in-room and massages can either be enjoyed outside with a view over the river, or in the privacy of your room.&#xA0; The clouds of spray generated by the thunderous curtain of water have resulted in a lush rain forest full of stunning wild flowers and the most spectacular views of the falls from the Zambian side of the gorge (depending on the season).&#xA0; The range of excursions that can be booked by the hotel includes sunset boat cruises on the tranquil Upper Zambezi above the falls, local village tours, game drives and nature trails.&#xA0; Those looking for more active adventures can sign up for canoeing, whitewater rafting and even bungee jumping.&#xA0;&#xA0;Helicopter and micro lite flights offer once-in-a-lifetime experiences as you fly above the falls and the long narrow gorge and the river that feeds it.&#xA0; You may see elephants crossing the river just above the falls!&#xA0; Horse riding is also offered in the Zambezi National Park to view elephant and buffalo and the newly relocated rhino.&#xA0; The best time to view the falls is probably between April/May and August when the spray is less, yet the flow of water is still impressive.&#xA0; As the dry season progresses, the volume of water over the falls declines quite dramatically.&#xA0; Visitors in late September to December need to be aware of this.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Royal Livingstone Hotel &#x2013; Luxury Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 16:&#xA0; Victoria Falls&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, your half-day adventure is an elephant-back safari.&#xA0; The four-hour trip starts from Thorntree Lodge, where tea, coffee and cordials are served.&#xA0; Then the guide gives a short introductory talk including safety aspects.&#xA0; Guests meet the elephants and their handlers, and the safari begins.&#xA0; It winds through riverine bush, across the Zambezi River onto islands.&#xA0; Mid-way through the ride, clients dismount and interact with the elephants while the guide gives an informative talk on the African elephant and its relationship with man.&#xA0; This afternoon, enjoy a private tour of the falls, one of the most spectacular natural sights in the world.&#xA0; Walk in the rainforest with a knowledgeable local guide.&#xA0; Visit Mukuni village, founded in the 13th century and later named after the ruler (Mukuni) on arrival from the Congo.&#xA0; Enjoy this opportunity meet the Leya people who live here, and get a glimpse of a traditional African village with a population of 7,000, a clinic, a basic school and boreholes for drinking water.&#xA0; You see how huts are built and decorated, and watch local crafts people work creating curios.&#xA0; Please realize this is a working village and not one built to amuse tourists.&#xA0; This evening you dine on the Royal Livingstone Express, a magnificent, romantic steam powered train, which runs along 20 kilometers of the historic Mulobezi railway line through the heart of the Zambezi River Valley.&#xA0; Passengers savor fine cuisine and excellent wines provided by the hotel as the train travels slowly towards the sunset through African countryside in fully restored Pullman-style coaches.&#xA0;&#xA0;The Royal Livingstone Express is made up of five carriages, two dining cars, a kitchen car, lounge car and an observation car.&#xA0; The train runs on the Mulobezi line, which was once the largest privately owned railway network in the world set up by Zambezi Sawmills in 1916.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Royal Livingstone Hotel &#x2013; Luxury Room (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Early this morning, you are escorted to the airport for your flight to Casablanca, Morocco.&#xA0; You are met upon arrival at the Mohamed V International Airport by your private licensed national guide as well as your driver and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; Casablanca, the largest city in Africa after Cairo, is home to the largest remaining Jewish community in Morocco with several congregations, active communal institutions and good kosher restaurants.&#xA0; Subject to the arrival time and your level of fatigue, you leave in late morning to visit the Museum of Moroccan Judaism (closed on Fridays).&#xA0; You will then see the magnificent Hassan II Mosque, the second largest mosque in the Islamic world after the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca.&#xA0; This mosque is closed to non-believers on Fridays after 9:00 AM.&#xA0; This architectural masterpiece, a symbol of an Islam open to the world, took seven years to complete using 50 million man-hours.&#xA0; It was built partially on the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, on the farthest western point of the Maghreb.&#xA0; Then you drive to the Corniche running alongside the Atlantic Ocean for a seafood lunch before reaching the seaside resort of A&#xEF;n Diab.&#xA0; You discover the Habous Quarter - the New Medina, a 1920s souk, and the King&#x2019;s Palace precinct.&#xA0; Return to your hotel, where you may visit the nearby old Medina adjacent to United Nations Square.&#xA0; About a century old, the Medina is a constant hive of activity, its cramped, narrow streets abound with merchants selling everything from fruit and vegetables to leather, brass and copper items, spices and clothing.&#xA0; In the old market, you come across kosher butchers next to butchers selling horse, sheep and goat meat.&#xA0; The Jewish cemetery in the Mellah is open and relatively quiet, with well-kept white stone markers in French, Hebrew and Spanish.&#xA0; The Rue Djemda Es Souk, one of the main streets of this Quarter, has among its special interests many shops on Rue de Rabat where a few Jewish goldsmiths still ply their trade.&#xA0; Many traditions were shared and sometimes even originated with the Arab and Berber population, with different groups worshipping many of the same saints.&#xA0; They also had a mutual fear of the evil eye, or jinn, as it was called, a constant threat of death.&#xA0; An unnaturally high number of deaths due to poor living conditions in the Mellah was often attributed to the evil eye.&#xA0; To ward off such bad luck, a khamsa was worn as a defense against the jinn.&#xA0; The khamsa, a flat silver or brass decorated hand, created by Jewish craftsmen, was worn by Jews and Muslims alike.&#xA0; A short walk away are half dozen synagogues on the long block of the Rue Lusitania.&#xA0; Later, you can have a drink at the American-owned Rick&#x2019;s Caf&#xE9;, complete with mahogany, wicker and ceiling fans &#x2013; images long associated with the classic movie, Casablanca.&#xA0; Before dinner, you will enjoy an oriental show in the Basmane Restaurant overlooking the ocean.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel &amp;amp; Spa Le Doge Casablanca &#x2013; Passion Suite (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;&#xD;
Day 16:&#xA0; Fes&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today&#x2019;s focus is Fes.&#xA0; For nearly three centuries, the Jewish community played an important role in the commercial and cultural life of this once capital city, and the religious capital of Morocco.&#xA0; The journey includes the old Mellah, also called "Fondouk El Yehoudi," the Jewish cemetery, Aben Danan renovated synagogue, the colorful es-Sabbaghine with its Street of the Dyers, brass workers at es-Saffarine, and the Bou Inania Medersa with its aromas of the Souq el-Atterine area of spices and groceries.&#xA0; See the delightful el-Nejjarine Square with its fountain and caravanserai, the el-Nejjarine fountain.&#xA0; The Community Centre, Centre Communautaire "Maimonide," is one of the best organized in Morocco, with a kosher restaurant and modern synagogue on the premises.&#xA0; The Center was created in the early 1980's in a building housing a Talmud Torah synagogue and school.&#xA0; Nearby, the Roben Ben Sadoun Synagogue, built in the 1920s, is decorated with exquisite plaster carving reminiscent of the decoration of traditional mosques and Medersas.&#xA0; Move on to the renowned Tanneries on the bank of the Oued Fes and then see pottery, perfume and beauty products at the Souq el-Henna.&#xA0; Leaving the Medina from the Bab Boujloud, tour the magnificent ramparts with its beautiful &#x2018;Babs&#x2019; as you make your way to the 16th century Sa&#xE2;dien watchtower at the North Borj, and the Dar Batha Museum with its collection of carpets and woodwork.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Palais Amani &#x2013; Classic Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

This morning, you head into the bustling Kasbah to the lavishly-decorated Sa&#xE2;dien Tombs, discovered in 1917 with some tombs dating from the middle 1550s.&#xA0; This is the ancient cemetery of the Shorfa, the descendants of the Prophet Mohammed.&#xA0; The Sa&#xE2;dien Dynasty relied heavily on Jewish traders, including Moroccan-controlled Timbuktu, to finance its wars against Portugal and the Turkish Empire, which had made Marrakech their capital and converted land adjoining the El Badii Palace into a Mellah.&#xA0; That became home of a thriving community of native and Spanish Jews, famed for their rabbinical schools and scholars.&#xA0; Visit the Rabbi Hanania Ha-Cohen Cemetery, which is also the burial place of Rabbis Mordechai Ben Attar and Pinhas Khalifa Ha-Cohen Azough, known as the &#x201C;Patron of Marrakech.&#x201D;&#xA0; This Mellah dates from the 1550s, as noted on the door to the Jewish cemetery and, unlike the Moslem old city or Medina, it has many three-story buildings towering over narrow streets, reflecting the crowded conditions of those who lived there until the 1960s.&#xA0; Synagogues were once found on every street, but few remain in open today.&#xA0; In the middle of the Mellah is a building that once housed a synagogue and a home for the elderly.&#xA0; Another synagogue is across from the Jewelers Market, where several Jewish goldsmiths still produce pendants of the hand of Fatima, a symbol of good luck to both Jews and Muslims and said to keep at bay evil spirits.&#xA0; On now to the late 19th century Bahia Palace that was built by craftsmen from Fes for the black slave Si' Ahmed Ben Musa after he had risen to power and wealth as the Grand Vizier of Sultan Moulay al-Hassan.&#xA0; The attractive, well-preserved Harem Courtyard has been featured in many movies.&#xA0; It took some 15 years to complete and has nearly 150 rooms.&#xA0; Continue to the Dar Si Sa&#xEF;d Museum, formally a palace dating from the late 1800s.&#xA0; Restored in 1997, it houses both traditional and contemporary exhibitions of Moroccan arts and sculpture.&#xA0; Wander into the Medina and the 14th century Ali Ben Youssef Medersa, one of the most beautiful buildings in Marrakech.&#xA0; It once housed the Islamic equivalent of a monastery.&#xA0; Founded in the 14th century, it was almost completely rebuilt during the Sa&#xE2;dien Dynasty.&#xA0; See the Almoravid Dynasty Koubba, one of the few architectural reminders of the dynasty that presided over the "Golden Age" of Jewish life in Spanish Andalusia and Morocco.&#xA0; This is the oldest building in Marrakech and the only Almoravid building to remain standing in Morocco.&#xA0; Stroll through the Marrakech Museum of Contemporary Art and/or explore the Bert Flint Museum, which represents 50 years of collecting by the Holland-born Flint as he travelled along the Gold Road from the Atlas Mountains to Timbuktu, crossing the regions of the Sahara and the Souss Valley.&#xA0; See his extensive collection of costumes, jewelry, arms, basketwork, musical instruments, Moroccan art, popular traditions and artifacts, carpets and furniture as displayed in a 12-th century riad.&#xA0; A labyrinth of narrow alleyways makes up the renowned cool, colorful and aromatic souqs of Marrakech.&#xA0; End the day in the Djma&#xE2; el Fna&#xE2; Square.&#xA0; Back at your hotel or riad, you can relax in the late afternoon or opt to venture further into the bustle of this cosmopolitan city until dinner late this evening.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Riad El Fenn &#x2013; Colonnade Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

After breakfast today, you set off up north along the Atlantic coastline to stop first at Safi, known also as Little Jerusalem.&#xA0; Safi boasts of having the first Muslim Mosque in the kingdom, as well as Portuguese buildings dating back more than five centuries.&#xA0; The world-renowned Safi pottery pieces elaborately trimmed with tooled silver overlay are beautifully displayed with their rich designs, styles, and colors, each piece having been wheel-thrown and hand-finished by skilled artisans.&#xA0; Continuing north alongside the Atlantic Ocean via Cap Beddouza you arrive at the seaside resort town of El Oualidia, a simple place still off the tourists&#x2019; map offers peace and quiet on the legendary Barbary Coast.&#xA0; See a hilltop Kasbah built in the 16th century.&#xA0; At the foot of the hill, there are the ruins of the once-elegant summer palace of Sultan Mohammed V (the grandfather of the current King Mohammed VI), its regal steps descending to within a few feet of a lagoon.&#xA0; Surrounded by lofty dark-green stone pines, and tumbled down for half a century now, the palace has a perfect view of the whole lagoon and the distant narrow breach into the ocean.&#xA0; El Oualidia&#x2019;s well-kept secret is its oyster beds, which sends oysters all over Morocco.&#xA0; You may see a fleet of candy-pink fishing boats lies high on the dunes overlooking the ocean, and avocets, cormorants, oystercatchers, stilts, and redshanks.&#xA0; You now continue to El Jadida, known as &#x201C;The New One.&#x201D;&#xA0; Founded in 1513 by the Portuguese as Mazagao, which was their first and last possession in Morocco, El Jadida is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&#xA0; It is a small, delightful coastal town with several three meter-thick bastions - L&#x2019;Ange, Saint Sebastian, Saint Antoine and Saint Esprit, which were destroyed in 1769 by the same Portuguese, who were forced to leave Morocco, but were subsequently restored to their former armed state.&#xA0; Taken back from the Portuguese in 1769, Mazagao was to become a Jewish Mellah (or Quarter).&#xA0; Your first stop is at the old fortress inside which lies an ancient structure that escaped the destruction of the fleeing Portuguese.&#xA0; The misnamed &#x201C;Portuguese Cisterns&#x201D;, as they were actually built by the Romans originally to store grain, were then used by the Portuguese as a fresh water cistern to withstand sieges.&#xA0; The Cistern was actually discovered by accident in 1977 by a Jewish spice merchant and where Orson Wells shot the riot scenes for his film Othello.&#xA0; You leave there to continue to the Porto do Mar to visit a communal bakery.&#xA0; A short walk brings you to the Bastion of St Sebastian, home of the old prison compound and the Tribunal of the Inquisition.&#xA0; You continue to the Mellah and an early19th-century synagogue, as the Star of David underneath a Muslim crescent on the wall testifies.&#xA0; Some believe it symbolizes the appreciation of the Jewish population of the time at being accepted by an Islamic country after fleeing Spain and persecution at the hands of the Inquisition and of their desire to integrate into Moroccan life.&#xA0; Integration was never really complete, however, as Jews here always lived under a different set of laws to those of Muslims (one was they were not allowed to wear shoes).&#xA0; No Jews live here now, as they relocated to Israel.&#xA0; On now to Azemmour, a natural port that has been under Carthaginian rule and later Portuguese control. Here, Dar el Baroud (powder storage house of the Portuguese) bastion guards the now-ruined Kasbah, the Arab medina and Jewish Mellah (the synagogue of Rabbi Abraham Moul Niss is still frequently used).&#xA0; The final leg of your journey takes you to the White City of Casablanca, where you explore the interior of the beautiful Hassan II Mosque (closed on Fridays), the second largest mosque in the Islamic world after the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca.&#xA0; This architectural masterpiece, a symbol of an Islam open to the world, took seven years to complete using 50 million man-hours.&#xA0; The mosque was inaugurated on August 30, 1993 and was built partially on the waters of the Atlantic Ocean on the farthest western point of the Maghreb.&#xA0; Conceived by the French architect Michel Pinseau (1924-1999), the mosque employed 3,300 craftsmen from all over Morocco.&#xA0; The mosque has 53,000 square meters of carved cedar wood, 67,000 square meters of plasterwork, and some 10,000 square meters of sculpted ornamentation and writings.&#xA0; It contains on the ground floor an oblong Prayer Hall of perfect symmetry measuring 200 x 100 meters.&#xA0; Supported by 78 pillars of granite, marble and onyx, this vast space supports a retractable roof covered with emerald green tiles - the symbolic color of Islam, representing Mother Earth.&#xA0; The Prayer Hall can welcome to prayer 25,000 believers inside and 80,000 on the adjoining esplanade.&#xA0; Embedded in the axis of the southern facade, a 210 meter-high minaret boasts a laser beam of 30 kilometer reach pointing towards Mecca.&#xA0; This magnificent mosque also encompasses a medersa (school of Koranic learning), a library, a national museum and immense lecture halls, all beautifully decorated by artisans from all over Morocco:&#xA0; frescoes and zelliges in traditional geometrical motifs; painted and sculptured woods, stuccos of intricate designs, arabesques in decorative drawings and writings in brilliant color.&#xA0; After touring the mosque, you check into your hotel for your final evening in Morocco.&#xA0; Staying at Le Doge is an enchanting experience.&#xA0; You are transported back to the Art Deco era as in each of the 16 rooms and suites is dedicated to an artist from that period.&#xA0; The sophistication, elegance and refinement of the Le Doge are carried on through to its gourmet restaurant, its spa and its hanging garden, the crowning glory of this exceptional hotel.&#xA0; Hotel Le Doge &#x2013; Passion Suite (B)&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10:&#xA0; Otavalo&#xA0;/ Quito&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;The land of the Otavalo Indians is perhaps the most important mainland attraction after the Amazon rainforest.&#xA0; A great deal of pride is displayed not only in the native handcrafts of this unique indigenous culture, but also in their dress, music and beliefs that have defied the passing of time.&#xA0; This morning, visit Otavalo, the biggest Indian handicraft market in South America, famous for its typical leather, wood, weaving antiques and jewelry markets as well as fruit and vegetables market.&#xA0; In the afternoon, return to Quito via a different scenic road. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;JW Marriott Hotel (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;This morning you will enjoy a serene boat ride across the Sea of Galilee to visit the lake sites,&#xA0;including Capernaum, which was a large Galilean fishing village and busy trading center.&#xA0; This place has a special interest to Christians due to its frequent mention in the history of Jesus, who left Nazareth to settle here.&#xA0; Peter, Andrew, James and John also lived at Capernaum.&#xA0; The remains of a basalt synagogue believed to be the synagogue where Jesus taught was discovered here. Next to the synagogue is &#x201C;Peter&#x2019;s House,&#x201D; where Jesus lived and healed many of his followers.&#xA0; Proceed to Tabgha, the traditional site of the calling of the disciples.&#xA0; A Byzantine mosaic is preserved under a modern church today that was once part of a church that commemorated Jesus&#x2019; feeding the multitudes.&#xA0; The monastery and church at Tabgha were destroyed in the 7th century, and buried beneath a thick layer of silt and stones.&#xA0; In the 1980s, the church was excavated and restored to its Byzantine form, incorporating portions of the original mosaics.&#xA0; The next stop is the Mount of Beatitudes, which has an excellent view of the Sea of Galilee.&#xA0; At this site, Jesus preached the Sermon on the Mount.&#xA0; Drive via Kfar Cana to the town of Nazareth nestled in a hollow plateau some 350 meters above sea level and 25 kilometers from the sea. &#xA0;According to the New Testament this town was the home of Joseph and Mary and the site of the Annunciation, when Mary was told by the angel Gabriel that she would have a son.&#xA0; Jesus spent his childhood in this town.&#xA0; Nazareth is home to many churches, including the Church of the Annunciation, the largest church in the Middle East.&#xA0; The Greek Orthodox Church, The Melkite Greek Catholic Church and a Franciscan Mensa Christi Church are also in town.&#xA0; The majority of its residents are Israeli Arabs (both Christian and Muslim) and the Jewish residents live in the Upper Nazareth area.&#xA0; Return to your hotel in Tiberias for overnight.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Scotts Hotel &#x2013; Antique Lake View Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive&#xA0;Santiago, Chile&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Chile.&#xA0; Upon arrival, you are greeted by your Big Five representative, assisted and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; This afternoon, enjoy a half-day city tour of Santiago, a sophisticated city of color and contrast.&#xA0; Take in the classic city landmarks - the old district with its provincial atmosphere; the European-style modern districts of Vitacura, Las Condes and Providencia; the Spanish colonial churches, gardens, and government palaces off the Plaza de Armas.&#xA0; See the energetic racetrack, university, and gracious estates dating from the 17th century. &#xA0;Rising above the streets of the capital, Cristobal Hill offers panoramic views of Santa Lucia, site of Santiago&#x2019;s founding in 1541, and the crumbling ruins of a 16th century fort.&#xA0; Discover the extensive collection of artifacts in the Museum of Pre-Columbian Art set up in a handsome colonial building, the Palacio de la Real Aduana (Royal Customs House).&#xA0; The collection includes intricately crafted ceramics, metals, textiles and wooden items.&#xA0; Tastefully presented and meticulously cared for, displays show a unique insight into the lost cultures of the Mayans, Aztecs, Incas and many other groups that once dominated this vast continent.&#xA0; (Museum is closed on Monday).&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ritz Carlton Hotel &#x2013; Club Room &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Santiago &#x2013; Wine Country &#x2013; Santiago&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;The wineries in the valley below Santiago are some of the oldest in Chile.&#xA0; Here you'll find most of the largest, oldest and best-known vineyards in the country.&#xA0; One of the most recognizable of Chile's wine appellations is the Maipo Valley, an area that stretches south from Santiago, and is the focus of your excursion to the wine country today.&#xA0; Begin at Aquitania Winery, a relatively new boutique, Bordeaux-style winery, a low-yield winery focusing on top quality wines utilizing the terroir concept.&#xA0; Then proceed to Chile's third-largest winery, Vi&#xF1;a Santa Rita, which played an important historical role in Chile's battle for independence.&#xA0; In 1814, 120 soldiers led by revolutionary hero Bernardo O'Higgins hid here in the cellars.&#xA0; Paula Jaraquemada, who ran the estate, refused to let the Spanish enter, saving the soldiers.&#xA0; At the center of Santa Rita's Maipo Valley estate, the lovely colonial hacienda now serves as the winery's headquarters.&#xA0; Enjoy lunch at the winery&#x2019;s restaurant, La Casa de Do&#xF1;a Paula, before exploring the winery's cellars.&#xA0; Built by French engineers in 1875 using a lime-and-stone technique, the fan-vault cellars have been named a national monument.&#xA0; The barrels that were once used to age the wines are more than 120 years old and are made of raul&#xED; wood.&#xA0; Today, however, the wine is aged in stainless-steel towers. &#xA0;(Aquitania and Santa Rita are both open from Tuesday to Friday).&#xA0; You will return back to Santiago later in the afternoon.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ritz Carlton Hotel &#x2013; Club Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Santiago / Mendoza, Argentina&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Transfer to the airport for your flight to Argentina.&#xA0; Upon arrival in Mendoza, you are met and transferred to Cavas Wine Lodge, a unique lodge at the foothills of the Andes and an ideal base to explore Argentina&#x2019;s winelands.&#xA0; The lodge is attractive to both wine lovers and those looking for a relaxing and revitalizing getaway.&#xA0; Mendoza's sun-kissed vineyards and mountain vistas rival Napa (California) and Stellenbosch (South Africa).&#xA0; Although just 20 minutes' drive from downtown Mendoza, Cavas Wine Lodge sits amid a tranquil, 14-hectare vineyard with views of year-round snowy peaks.&#xA0; The underground cellar is stacked with dozens of Argentina's most notable labels.&#xA0; Other vineyards such as Catena Zapata, Norton and Finca La Anita are conveniently nearby.&#xA0; Locally produced olive oils, herbs and spices enrich the kitchen's quite exceptional output.&#xA0; The lodge even has wine-therapy treatments available in the modest spa.&#xA0; The main house remains faithful to Spanish colonial traditions.&#xA0; Sunlight floods into the cavernous sitting room and lobby, where guests can play the Schiedmayer &amp;amp; Soehne grand piano.&#xA0; Each room is actually a 90-square-meter adobe-walled apartment positioned among the vines.&#xA0; Inside, a sitting room, discreetly equipped with flat-screen TV, CD/DVD player, cordless phone and Wi-Fi, leads to a bedroom and a bathroom with twin basins, a stand-alone bath and separate shower.&#xA0; Each apartment opens on to its own Andes-facing patio with plunge pool.&#xA0; On the roof, a chill-out mattress provides 360-degree views of the bodega.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Cavas Wine Lodge (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Mendoza / Buenos Aires&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Enjoy a leisurely morning before you transfer to the airport for your flight to Buenos Aires, where you are welcomed on arrival and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; This vivacious capital has a multi-faceted personality, from sophisticated European-style architecture, gardened parks and broad boulevards, to a pulsating tango nightlife and unique local neighborhoods of great character and charm.&#xA0; This afternoon you&#x2019;ll enjoy a half-day tour of one of the largest urban concentrations in the Southern Hemisphere.&#xA0; Begin with the historic Plaza de Mayo, surrounded by Government House, Metropolitan Cathedral and the old city hall, once the seat of Spanish Viceroys.&#xA0; Continue along May Avenue and notice the prominent Spanish influence.&#xA0; From Congress Square facing the national parliament, drive along Callao Street to the intersection of Corrientes Avenue and the most emblematic symbol of Buenos Aires, the Obelisk.&#xA0; You pass by one of the widest avenues in the world, namely, 9 of July Boulevard, as well as the famous Colon Opera House on your way to one of the most fashionable districts of the city, Recoleta.&#xA0; It is noted for its French charm, spacious Palermo Parks, and for the cemetery, where Evita Peron and other prominent citizens are buried.&#xA0; Take in the eccentric, bohemian neighborhood of La Boca, established by Italian immigrants.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Park Hyatt Buenos Aires &#x2013; Park Deluxe King (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Buenos Aires&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today&#x2019;s focus is a full-day excursion to an Argentinean estancia.&#xA0; El Rosario del Areco, only about 71 miles away from Buenos Aires, is a typical colonial farmhouse that has been completely renovated and reflects a distinct family atmosphere. &#xA0;The main house, built in 1892, is surrounded by a 14-hectare park that includes stables and two swimming pools.&#xA0; After arriving at the estancia, sample the delicious, traditional empanadas, meat pastries that are either oven-baked or deep fried.&#xA0;&#xA0;Explore the grounds on foot or take the opportunity to ride a horse.&#xA0; Horse-carriage rides are available.&#xA0; See a display of the gaucho riding style that has developed over the centuries.&#xA0; The main priority is comfort as these Argentinean cowboys can spend many hours in the saddle.&#xA0; The very pace of the horse itself is gentle, with a particular easy loping canter that both horse and rider can keep up for hours, if necessary.&#xA0; After a drive, sit down at long trestle tables to enjoy a lunch of the famous asado &#x2013; beef and ribs roasted slowly over a charcoal or wood fire; preceded by chorizo or black sausages accompanied by Argentinian wines.&#xA0; After a relaxing day in the countryside, return to Buenos Aires and your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Park Hyatt&#xA0;Buenos Aires &#x2013; Park Deluxe King (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; Buenos Aires&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; Buenos Aires / Iguassu Falls, Brazil&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;You transfer to the airport to fly to the magnificent Iguassu Falls.&#xA0; You are met on arrival and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; Even before the Spanish reached South America&#x2019;s greatest waterfall in 1541, the local Indians had named it Igua&#xE7;u, great waters.&#xA0; A fitting description of these falls - all 275 of them!&#xA0; The two-mile wide curtain of water crashing 300 feet over a series of precipices into a spray-filled gorge ranks among one of the peak experiences of South America.&#xA0; Explore the falls from the Argentine side that has a visitor center that features a patio with restaurants, souvenir shops, an amphitheatre and a space dedicated to the park&#xB4;s ecosystem.&#xA0; The entrance fee includes two train tickets and a boat ride that crosses over to the San Martin Island.&#xA0; There is also an exhibition, in Spanish only, about the history of indigenous people of this region.&#xA0; The train terminal is at Central Station, some 400 meters away from the main gate.&#xA0; Here is where the first leg starts &#x2013; you can either ride the train or take a 20-minute walk along Sendero Verde (green trail).&#xA0; Either way, you reach Cataratas Station, the starting point to the Upper Circuit. &#xA0;The Upper Circuit is a half-hour walk along a 1200-meter trail &#x2013; with low degree of difficulty and no stairs &#x2013; that goes deep into the jungle, where you encounter breathtaking views of the falls. &#xA0;You will have much closer views at the different observation points toward the end of the trail. &#xA0;The Lower Circuit requires more physical effort because of its stairs, but it can be done if you take it slowly, resting at the different viewpoints.&#xA0; On this trail, you will also walk deep into the jungle, crossing streams.&#xA0; The Lower Circuit goes all the way down to the river, where the boat crosses over to San Martin Island.&#xA0; On the way down, balconies offer marvelous bottom-up views of the falls.&#xA0; &lt;em&gt;Please note: If you have any physical impairment, do not attempt this last section.&lt;/em&gt; The second leg of the train ride leaves from Cataratas Station and goes to Garganta del Diablo Station, a small area with refreshments and restrooms.&#xA0; The trail goes across several branches of the upper Iguazu River, deep into the rainforest.&#xA0; Visitors see a variety of birdlife such as the amazing toucans.&#xA0; Garganta del Diablo (Devil&#x2019;s throat) is a 70-meter-deep pot where several branches of the Iguazu River converge, causing a violent rush of water.&#xA0; A balcony set up at the border allows tourists to enjoy this amazing experience.&#xA0; After your tour, you will then be transferred across the border to your hotel which is located in Brazil.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Das Cataratas Hotel &#x2013; Superior Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10:&#xA0; Iguassu Falls / Rio de Janeiro&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, enjoy a walking tour of the falls from the Brazilian side.&#xA0; A trail winds towards the falls from the area in front of the Das Cataratas Hotel.&#xA0; At its end, an elevator provides speedy access to a viewing platform at the foot of the falls.&#xA0; Focal point of the falls, best seen from above, is the Devil&#x2019;s Throat, a horseshoe-shaped gorge in mid-stream, over which seems to pour most of the Iguassu River at the phenomenal rate of 13,000 cubic meters a second.&#xA0; Transfer to the airport for your flight to Rio de Janeiro.&#xA0; Upon arrival you are met and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; Rio is a city that will amaze, delight and fascinate you.&#xA0; From the sun-drenched beauty of its white sandy beaches to the generous hospitality of the people, Rio offers a combination that is hard to match.&#xA0; It is at once both a tropical beach resort and a sophisticated city.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Fasano &#x2013; Deluxe Ocean Front Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11:&#xA0; Rio de Janeiro&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This afternoon, enjoy a city tour of Rio and Sugar Loaf Mountain.&#xA0; Rio de Janeiro was the capital of the most important Portuguese colony abroad.&#xA0; In the 1820s, it became the capital of Portuguese Brazil when the Portuguese royal court fled Portugal because of the threat of an invasion by Napoleon.&#xA0;&#xA0;Your tour explores these facets of the city.&#xA0; Discover the French influence as seen in the city&#x2019;s architecture and its counterpart, the Portuguese interpretation of the baroque movement, which finds its best example in the S&#xE3;o Bento Monastery, founded at the first few days of Rio as a settlement in 1546.&#xA0; It became a basilica in 1596.&#xA0; In tune with this European influence, Rio&#x2019;s modern architecture has set the trend for the building of Bras&#xED;lia, Brazil&#x2019;s modern capital.&#xA0; Sugar Loaf is known world over as the iconic symbol of Rio.&#xA0; It is reached on a very short two-stage cable car ride.&#xA0; The first stage, Morro da Urca, has a restaurant, amphitheater, helipad for scenic rides and offers lovely views of the Yacht Club and Botafogo Bay.&#xA0; The second stage travels up to Sugar Loaf, named for the similarity to the loaves of sugar that were commonly used by the Portuguese at the time.&#xA0; The all-encompassing views from the 270-meter high lookout are unrivaled, and this is the only site where you enjoy a full view of Copacabana beach.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Fasano &#x2013; Deluxe Ocean Front Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 12:&#xA0; Rio de Janeiro&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today you will have a private tour of Tijuca Forest and Corcovado Mountain. &#xA0;Tijuca Forest is the largest urban forest in the world.&#xA0; It covers the hills of Rio and is easily accessible from the city.&#xA0; You will be picked up from your hotel and driven to the Tijuca Forest.&#xA0; Enter through the tree farm where the contrast between the "Stone Jungle" and a tropical forest in the middle of a city is dramatic.&#xA0; Stop at Vista Chinesa to take pictures, and to learn about the reforestation project taking place in the Tijuca Forest and the importance of the Atlantic jungle.&#xA0; See the Emperor's Table, where the imperial family used to picnic, Cascatinha Waterfall, Mayrink Chapel, tropical vegetation, and vibrant butterflies and birds.&#xA0; You may also see monkeys and sloths.&#xA0; Set out for a one-hour trek along an easy trail to explore the botany of the area. &#xA0;This is a favorite weekend spot for the city-dwellers to get into nature. &#xA0;You end your trip with a visit to the famous, 120-foot statue of Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado Mountain. &#xA0;At Corcovado train station, you will board the cogwheel train for a 15-minute ride up to the statue's base.&#xA0; Once there, at an elevation of 2,400 feet, take in the marvel of&#xA0; construction of the statue, and enjoy magical vistas of Rio, its beaches and Guanabara Bay, fanning out in a magnificent 360 degree panoramic view.&#xA0; After lunch, the balance of the day is at leisure to explore the city independently.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Fasano &#x2013; Deluxe Ocean Front Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 13:&#xA0; Rio de Janeiro / Depart&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today you are free to pursue your own interests.&#xA0; Shop, lounge on the beach, or take an optional trip to Petr&#xF3;polis, the Emperor Dom Pedro II's summer home, or perhaps take a schooner cruise to the islands south of the city for a day of secluded beach combing.&#xA0; For your convenience your room is available until 6:00 pm.&#xA0; Later this evening you will be transferred to the airport for your late night departure.&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Cambodia! &#xA0;Upon arrival you will be met and transferred to your hotel before beginning your afternoon sightseeing.&#xA0; The crowning jewel of Khmer architecture, Angkor Wat is the national symbol and the highlight of any visit to Cambodia.&#xA0; The largest, best preserved, and most religiously significant of the Angkor temples, Angkor impresses visitors both by its sheer scale and beautifully proportioned layout, as well as the delicate artistry of its carvings. &#xA0;To approach the temple, first cross the vast moat, continuing along a broad causeway lined with naga balustrades.&#xA0; As you enter the main building, ascend through a series of galleries and courtyards before reaching the central sanctuary, which offers beautiful views back over the causeway and across the surrounding countryside.&#xA0; On the way, stop to enjoy the intricate stone carvings that adorn nearly every surface, with some 1,700 Apsaras, or celestial dancers, sculpted into the walls.&#xA0; Along the outer gallery walls run the longest continuous bas-relief in the world, which narrates stories from Hindu mythology, including the famous Churning of the Ocean of Milk.&#xA0; Angkor Wat is stunning at any time of the day, but sunrise and sunset are especially beautiful times to watch the play of light on the stones.&#xA0; Seemingly miniature in comparison to the other Angkor temples, Banteay Srei is considered to be the jewel of classical Khmer art.&#xA0; Built in pink sandstone, the walls are covered in exquisitely preserved carvings of unusual delicacy. &#xA0;Because of its small size, fairy-like atmosphere and extraordinary examples of Khmer sculpture, this temple is often a favorite with visitors.&#xA0; Watch the sunset over the Cambodian countryside from the upper terraces of an ancient Angkorian temple.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Park Hyatt Siem Reap&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Siem Reap&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;The fortified city of Angkor Thom covers an area of 10 square kilometers.&#xA0; Enclosed by a wall and wide moats, the city includes many of Angkor's most popular sights. &#xA0;Enter by the monumental South Gate over a causeway lined on either side by statues of demons and gods, each carrying a giant naga.&#xA0; Continue to the Terrace of the Elephants and the Terrace of the Leper Kings, former spaces for public ceremonies, both adorned with dramatic bas reliefs.&#xA0; Visit the ruined Baphuon, Royal Enclosure and Phimeanakas before continuing to the mysterious Bayon Temple.&#xA0; In this temple, one of the most popular and compelling in Angkor, explore the galleries of beautifully preserved bas reliefs and ascend narrow stairs to reach the central sanctuary, where you will find giant stone faces smiling enigmatically down at you from every angle.&#xA0; Your next stop is Prasat Kravan, the five brick towers were built for Hindu worship in 921 AD, and are noted for the bas-reliefs cut into the bricks on the interior walls.&#xA0; Banteay Kdei is a massive Buddhist temple dating from the second half of the 12th century.&#xA0; It is surrounded by four concentric walls, the outer walls measuring 500 by 700 meters. &#xA0;Continue on to Sras Srang, a basin opposite Banteay Kdei, measuring 800 by 400 meters with a tiny island in the middle where only the stone base remains of what was once a wooden temple.&#xA0; Ta Prohm is one of the most popular sites at Angkor as it is still cloaked in the jungle and looks very much as all the Angkor monuments would have appeared to the first European explorers who stumbled across them hundreds of years ago.&#xA0; Ta Keo was built by Jayavarman V, who ruled from 968 to 1001, and was the first Angkorian monument built entirely of sandstone.&#xA0; The summit of the central tower is 50 meters high and surrounded by four lower towers.&#xA0; Thommanon Temple mirrors Chau Say Tevoda just to the north because it built around the same time, the second quarter of the 12th century, with a similar plan.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Park Hyatt Siem Reap (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;Today is at leisure to explore the area.&#xA0; Your private guide is available to assist with the many leisure options that are offered.&#xA0; You may choose to visit the Indian market in Aguas Calientes village or explore the hotel&#x2019;s cloud forest trails including the Orchid Garden which features some 372 species of the exotic flower as well as endemic birds as the Cock of the Rock, Peru&#x2019;s national bird and 18 types of hummingbirds.&#xA0; For those who wish to return to the archaeological site, your guide will provide you with a round trip bus ticket and admission fee, and will privately accompany you back to Machu Picchu.&#xA0; For a truly mystical experience, those early risers who like to hike can climb Huayna Picchu peak, situated opposite of Machu Picchu, for breathtaking views of the imposing ruins and the Urubamba Valley below.&#xA0; You may also walk along to the Sun Gate, the last segment of the famous Inca Trail.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Inkaterra Machu Picchu Hotel &#x2013; Superior Room (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Machu Picchu / Cusco&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, you will return to Ollanta station via the Vistadome Valley train, where you will be met and taken to explore some of the Inca ruins on the outskirts of Cusco.&#xA0; The archaeological capital of South America is rich in pre-Columbian remains such as the Tambomachay, the Inca Baths with their sophisticated canal system; Qenqo ceremonial altar; Puca Pucara (Red Tower Fortress), which took more than 80 years to build; and the vast Sacsayhuaman Fortress site of ancient religious celebrations.&#xA0; Here, you will see three parallel levels of fortifications constructed out of enormous rocks - some weighing an estimated 30 tons - which fit flawlessly together without the use of any mortar.&#xA0; Across the parade ground is the solid rock throne where Sapa Inca Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca Empire, is reputed to have sat while viewing his troops.&#xA0; You will then continue to Cusco and your hotel.&#xA0; High in the Andes, about 11,400 feet above sea level, Cusco is considered the oldest continuously inhabited city in the Western Hemisphere, and as such is of major historical importance.&#xA0; The Incas first began to emerge in the 12th century around Cusco, with their power at its peak in the 1440s to early 1500s.&#xA0; Over time, they built their capital in the shape of a Puma with the river serving as the spine, and Sacsayhuaman the head and the main city center the body.&#xA0; Almost every central street has remains of Inca walls, arches and doorways.&#xA0; Many streets are lined with Inca stonework, which now serve as foundations for more modern buildings.&#xA0; Inca stonework is tapered upwards (battered) and every wall has a perfect line of inclination towards the center, from bottom to top.&#xA0; The stones have each edge and corner rounded.&#xA0;&#xA0;Cusco was conquered by Spain in the mid-16th century, and much of the city&#x2019;s architecture reflects the dramatic Spanish style known as Cusco Baroque. &#xA0;In many instances, the Spanish built on top of Incan foundations.&#xA0; The colonial-era treasures include mansions and churches such as the Cathedral, La Merced Convent, and La Compania are examples of this practice.&#xA0; Churches are full of marvelous works from the Cusco School of painting, distinguished by its mix of Catholic and pagan imagery.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Monasterio &#x2013; Deluxe Oxygenated Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; Cusco&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, your half-day discovery of this magical city takes you on a drive through the main streets.&#xA0; Visit the Qorikancha, Sun Temple, now referred to as Santo Domingo Church.&#xA0; The curved stonework of the temple is probably unequaled in the world.&#xA0; During the Inca period, the stones were covered with gold.&#xA0; You will then visit the San Pedro local market where you see the everyday life of the city.&#xA0; Proceed to &#x201C;San Blas,&#x201D; the Artisans&#x2019; Neighborhood of narrow and high streets, beautiful little plaza, where the artists craft wool, clay and wood into real art pieces.&#xA0; Continue to see the famous Twelve Angles stone, part of the largest Inca wall in Cusco.&#xA0; This used to be the Hatunrumiyoc, &#x201C;Big Stone&#x201D; palace built by Inca Sinchi Roca.&#xA0; This is a fine example of Inca skill with polygonal masonry.&#xA0; Drive to Villa Tip&#xF3;n, located in Cusco Valley, where you have the chance to meet a local Peruvian family.&#xA0; Enjoy lunch at the farm with your hosts.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Monasterio &#x2013; Deluxe Oxygenated Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; Cusco / Lima / Depart&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Transfer to the airport for your return flight to Lima.&#xA0; Upon arrival you will be met and assisted to your day room at your hotel, located conveniently at the airport.&#xA0; You have the remainder of the day at leisure to explore on your own or just relax.&#xA0; This evening, you will be met and assisted with check-in to your international departure flight.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Costa Del Sol Ramada &#x2013; Jr. Suite Day Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

&lt;/ul&gt;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Buenos Aires,&#xA0;Argentina&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Argentina.&#xA0; Upon arrival, you will be met by your Big Five Argentina representative and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; For your convenience, you have been pre-registered in order to allow you to have immediate access to your room.&#xA0; The capital city offers something for everyone: sophisticated European-style architecture, parks and broad boulevards, pulsating tango nightlife, and unique local neighborhoods of great character and charm.&#xA0; This afternoon, you&#x2019;ll enjoy a half-day tour of one of the largest urban concentrations in the Southern Hemisphere.&#xA0; This tour starts at the historical Plaza de Mayo surrounded by the Government House (Pink House), the Metropolitan Cathedral and the ancient City-Hall, seat of the former Spanish Viceroys.&#xA0; Continue along May Avenue, an area of strong Spanish influence,&#xA0;to Congress Square facing the National Parliament.&#xA0; Drive along Callao Street to the intersection with lively Corrientes Avenue.&#xA0; Here, you&#x2019;ll see the most emblematic symbol of Buenos Aires, the Obelisk, the famous Colon Opera House, and one of the widest avenues in the world, 9 of July Boulevard.&#xA0; Travel to one of the most fashionable districts of the city, Recoleta, noted for its French charm, spacious Palermo Parks, and for the cemetery where Evita Peron and other prominent citizens are buried.&#xA0; Take in the eccentric, bohemian neighborhood of La Boca, established by Italian immigrants.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Hub Porte&#xF1;o Hotel Boutique&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Buenos Aires&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Depart on a full-day excursion to a typical Argentinean estancia. El Omb&#xFA; de Areco, a historical estancia (ranch) just over an hour's drive from downtown Buenos Aires, is located in San Antonio de Areco, birthplace of the gaucho tradition. The late colonial-style mansion, built in 1880 by Lieutenant General Pablo Riccheri, offers visitors a magnificent setting for an unforgettable day out. The main house is surrounded by a covered gallery typical of the late-colonial period, with a richly tiled floor and cascading steps that lead to gardens of the park. Presiding majestically over the park is the estancia's namesake, the great omb&#xFA; (Phytolacca dioca), a plant as characteristic of the pampas as the baobab is of the African savanna. Here gauchos have been hitching their horses to the estancia's main omb&#xFA; for over a hundred years. Centennial oaks, araucarias (monkey-puzzle trees), palms, eucalyptus, casuarinas and magnolias adorn the four-hectare (ten-acre) park, tempting guests to stroll about and enjoy the scent of gardenias, roses and lime trees. The park and surrounding ranch land, with its natural lagoons and small water courses running to the Areco River, offer a rich habitat to a large proportion of Argentina's 1,000 bird species. Explore the 750 acre estancia on foot or, accompanied by seasoned gauchos, on horseback. Horse-drawn carriages are also available. Learn about some of the thousand species of Argentinean birds with the use of the estancia&#x2019;s binoculars and guidebooks. Twenty kilometers from the estancia sits historic San Antonio de Areco, a picturesque pampas pueblo, with its museums, such as the famous Ricardo G&#xFC;iraldes Gaucho Museum, silversmiths, leather craftsmen, and wood workshops, a delightful little chocolate factory, and frequent country auctions, all of which serve to keep alive the traditions of the gaucho culture. &#xA0;Enjoy a delicious asado (barbecue) served with fine Argentine wines. Transfer back to Buenos Aires late afternoon. &lt;strong&gt;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Hub Porte&#xF1;o Hotel Boutique&lt;/strong&gt; (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Buenos Aires&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&#x201C;It takes two to Tango&#x201D;... so the&#xA0;saying goes, which shows you just how popular and widespread&#xA0;this dance has become. The tango is a city dance, native to the city of Buenos Aires, so where else should we go to learn and enjoy it?&#xA0; This unique afternoon tango tour traces the life of the most prominent figure in the history of tango: Carlos Gardel. You will be guided to the city&#x2019;s typical tango spots and stop for a coffee at traditional Caf&#xE9; Tortoni. The excursion ends&#xA0;with a&#xA0;tango lesson lead by professional tango dancers. Discover the culture and passion for tango with all the magic and charm of the dance! Note: Dancers must make sure to pack a pair of shoes without rubber soles to ensure smooth gliding across the dance floor. This evening, enjoy the popular Rojo Tango Show.&#xA0; Love, passion, madness, glamour...Rojo Tango is a show of international standing in which history becomes legend.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Hub Porte&#xF1;o Hotel Boutique &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;You transfer to the airport to fly to the phenomenal Iguassu Falls.&#xA0; You are met on arrival and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; Long before the Spanish reached South America&#x2019;s greatest waterfall in 1541, the local Indians had named it Igua&#xE7;u, great waters.&#xA0; A fitting description of these falls - all 275 of them!&#xA0; The two-mile wide curtain of water crashing 300 feet over a series of precipices into a spray-filled gorge ranks among one of the peak experiences of South America.&#xA0; Explore the falls from the Argentine side that has a visitor center that features a patio with restaurants, souvenir shops, an amphitheatre and a space dedicated to the park&#xB4;s ecosystem.&#xA0; The entrance fee includes two train tickets and a boat ride that crosses over to the San Martin Island.&#xA0; There is also an exhibition, in Spanish only, about the history of indigenous people of this region.&#xA0; The train terminal is at Central Station, some 400 meters away from the main gate.&#xA0; Here is where the first leg starts &#x2013; you can either ride the train or take a 20-minute walk along Sendero Verde (green trail).&#xA0; Either way, you reach Cataratas Station, the starting point to the Upper Circuit.&#xA0; The Upper Circuit is a half-hour walk along a 1200-meter trail &#x2013; with low degree of difficulty and no stairs &#x2013; that goes deep into the jungle, where you encounter breathtaking views of the falls.&#xA0; You will have much closer views at the different observation points toward the end of the trail. &#xA0;The Lower Circuit requires more physical effort because of its stairs, but it can be done if you take it slowly, resting at the different viewpoints.&#xA0; On this trail, you will also walk deep into the jungle, crossing streams.&#xA0; The Lower Circuit goes all the way down to the river, where the boat crosses over to San Martin Island.&#xA0; On the way down, balconies offer marvelous bottom-up views of the falls.&#xA0; &lt;em&gt;Please note: If you have any physical impairment, do not attempt this last section.&lt;/em&gt; The second leg of the train ride leaves from Cataratas Station and goes to Garganta del Diablo Station, a small area with refreshments and restrooms.&#xA0; The trail goes across several branches of the upper Iguazu River, deep into the rainforest.&#xA0; Visitors see a variety of birdlife such as the amazing toucans.&#xA0; Garganta del Diablo (Devil&#x2019;s throat) is a 70-meter-deep pot where several branches of the Iguazu River converge, causing a violent rush of water.&#xA0; A balcony set up at the border allows tourists to enjoy this amazing experience.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Sheraton Iguaz&#xFA; Resort &amp;amp; Spa&#xA0;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Arusha / Tarangire National Park / Manyara Ranch Conservancy&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning depart overland to Tarangire National Park, complete with picnic lunch. Tarangire is home to great herds of elephant, during the dry season up to 300 can be found along the dry river bed, digging for underground streams, while migratory wildebeest, zebra, buffalo, impala, gazelle, hartebeest and eland flock to the remaining pools.&#xA0; During the rainy season, the animals spread out over 12,500 square miles.&#xA0; The swamps serve as host to 550 bird varieties.&#xA0; The park extends into two game-controlled areas so the wildlife can move freely. Following your game activities, head into what some call the future of safaris in Tanzania, the Manyara Ranch, a 35,000 acre wildlife conservancy situated in the corridor between Tarangire and Manyara National Park. Originally established as a cattle ranch during Tanzania's colonial period, Manyara Ranch remains an operating ranch with a relatively small herd of beef cattle and black-headed sheep. During 2000, the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) obtained management and conservation rights to the ranch to protect these wildlife corridors. In so doing, they established a working relationship with the Maasai, developing their community conservation projects and rehabilitating the ranch itself. The ranch is held in Trust by the Tanzania Land Conservation Trust (TLCT) for the benefit of the local communities and Tanzania.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Manyara Ranch Conservancy (B,LD)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

Your experience here will be like none other, the conservancy provides guided game walks, day and night drives, visits to partner villages (in an authentic setting) and activities including horse riding with big game, bush breakfast and dinners and participative research activities to promote on-going conservation projects in collaboration with the African Wildlife Foundation. Several large dams on the ranch that attract and retain the wildlife within the conservancy area. There is a significant resident population of wildlife including groups of large bull elephants, breeding herds of giraffe, many lesser kudu, wildebeest, zebra, gazelle, oryx and eland. There are also predators, including lion, cheetah, leopard, hyena, jackal and bat-eared foxes. For many years, wild dogs have denned on the ranch. The resident game population is continually being increased by wildlife moving through the migratory corridors. There is a large number of species of birds including many raptors on the ranch. Manyara Ranch has a variety of habitats, which include open savannah, acacia woodland, bush and riverine forest. These habitats support a large diversity of wildlife and birdlife. &lt;strong&gt;Manyara Ranch Conservancy (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Manyara Ranch Conservancy / Ngorongoro Crater&lt;/strong&gt;Indulge your sense of personal discovery as you near Ngorongoro Crater.&#xA0; In 1892, a German explorer was the first European to record seeing the crater.&#xA0; You will approach it in much the same way he did - via Lake Manyara.&#xA0; Certainly one of the world&#x2019;s most remarkable natural wonders, the crater&#x2019;s steep unbroken rim drops some 2,000 feet to the basin that encompasses 102 square miles.&#xA0; This may have been one of the world&#x2019;s tallest mountains until about two million years ago, when a volcano exploded, collapsing it into this massive crater.&#xA0; Today, Maasai pastoralists and their grazing cattle and goats share this stage with 30,000 animals &#x2013; lions, elephants, rhinos, wildebeest, flocks of flamingos and so much more.&#xA0; The safari lodge rests&#xA0;on the rim of the crater, and its design was inspired by traditional Maasai homesteads.&#xA0; Interiors hint at the days of early settlers.&#xA0; Beneath grass roofs, exquisite beaded chandeliers, antiques, silk curtains and leather chairs blend with African art.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ngorongoro Crater Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Ngorongoro Crater&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;The day&#x2019;s focus is the crater floor, reached by driving a rocky track down the steep side.&#xA0; Game viewing here is excellent throughout the year.&#xA0; You come startlingly close to some of the crater&#x2019;s lions.&#xA0; Amid dramatic landscapes dotted with buffalo, zebra, reedbuck and rhinos, you relish every morsel of your picnic lunch.&#xA0; Large numbers of flamingos hang out around the lake in the bottom of the crater.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ngorongoro Crater Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Ngorongoro Crater / Serengeti National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today your destination is the spectacular Serenget as you transfer to Manyara Airstrip for your flight to the Serengeti, Africa&#x2019;s most famous park is without equal in its primitive natural beauty, its liberating open space and its fantastic abundance of plains game.&#xA0;With more than 2 million wildebeest and 250,000 zebra, the area is home to the greatest concentration of plains game in Africa while also supporting more than 30 species of large herbivores.&#xA0; Increasing pressures leave this iconic ecosystem under threat. One of the big cats of the plains&#xA0;is the cheetah. One vital nonprofit research project&#xA0;is the&#xA0;&lt;em&gt;Serengeti Cheetah Project,&#xA0;&lt;/em&gt;the source of much of what is known about wild cheetahs today, including their ecology, ranging patterns and behaviors. The study area currently covers some 220 square kilometers of plains in the southern corner of the Serengeti National Park. With approximately 210 cheetahs within the ecosystem, this research project provides invaluable insight into the challenges facing these cheetahs, which in turn helps mitigate the threats they face and ensures their long-term protection.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Olakira Camp or Namiri Plains (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 8/9:&#xA0; Serengeti National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Over the next two days, your wilderness camp actually follows the animals &#x2013; hyenas and jackals, ostrich and cranes, giraffes, impalas, elephants, lions, and maybe the elusive leopard.&#xA0; With more than 500 bird species in the park, bird watching can leave you breathless.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Olakira Camp or Namiri Plains(B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10:&#xA0; Serengeti National Park / Arusha / Depart&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Savor one last early morning game drive before you leave this fabled land.&#xA0; Return to Arusha via a scenic flight over the Great Rift Valley.&#xA0; Enjoy dinner before returning to the airport.&#xA0; You must say &#x201C;Kwaheri&#x201D; (Swahili goodbye).&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Duluti Lodge &#x2013; Day Room (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Cape Town, South Africa&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
On arrival at Cape Town airport, look for our representative who will privately transfer you to your hotel.&#xA0; The Cape Grace has something of the atmosphere of a 'country house,' yet it's situated on a private quay overlooking the yacht marina in Cape Town's Victoria &amp;amp; Alfred Waterfront.&#xA0; One, their waterfront restaurant is a vibrant combination of friendly, seamless service, relaxed atmosphere and culinary flair, reflecting a modern South African influence.&#xA0; Bascule Whisky Bar and Wine Cellar on the water's edge provides the ideal setting for sampling the largest collection of whiskies in the Southern Hemisphere.&#xA0; The Cape Grace also has a well-stocked library, an&#xA0;&#xA0; enticing African-influenced spa, gym and a heated outdoor pool.&#xA0; Special services include personalized picnic baskets for an afternoon on the beach and romantic special touches for honeymoon couples.&#xA0; Well-appointed and elegant, the 120 spacious rooms and suites have French doors with inviting mountain and maritime views as well as sitting areas, walk-in dressing rooms, air-conditioning, TV, telephone, and internet access.&#xA0; The impeccable, yet friendly, service and refined taste throughout the hotel make the Cape Grace the discerning choice.&#xA0; Cape Town is one of the most beautifully situated cities in the world. Cradled by Table Mountain, it has a great deal of charm and historical interest.&#xA0; The city&#x2019;s charm is partly explained by Table Mountain, which breaks up the city into distinct areas, each with its own personality and, indeed, its own weather!&#xA0; The city bowl basks in the dramatic shadow of the 1000-meter high mountain, with its characteristic 'tablecloth' of mist rolling over the edge.&#xA0; The fashionable Waterfront and City Bowl areas are ideal for visitors who enjoy city life with plenty of restaurants, cafes and clubs within walking distance of your hotel.&#xA0; With a unique cultural blend of African, European and Asian influences, the city offers a cosmopolitan dining experience.&#xA0; The evening shopping at the Waterfront is great if you have little time in the city.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Cape Grace Hotel &#x2013; Luxury Room &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Cape Town&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
With your private guide, you set out on a private, half-day tour of Table Mountain and Cape Town this morning.&#xA0; Begin with a cable car ride up the mountain for panoramic views of the Cape Peninsula.&#xA0; (&lt;em&gt;The cable car tickets are on your own account as the ascent is weather dependent.&lt;/em&gt;) Then travel the city, with your first stop at the Castle of Good Hope, the original fort of Cape Town built in 1652 and now painstakingly restored.&#xA0; The castle was built by the Dutch between 1666 and 1679 to replace their original mud-walled fortress.&#xA0; From there, continue to the lovely flower market and the historic center of Cape Town with its many 18th-century buildings, where you enjoy a stroll through the Company Gardens, past the Parliament buildings.&#xA0; Finally, you explore the colorful Malay quarter, a historic sector of the city with original Malay buildings and narrow streets.&#xA0; Finish your tour at the waterfront and harbor. &lt;strong&gt;Cape Grace Hotel &#x2013; Luxury Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Cape Town&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Your private guide meets you for your private Cape Peninsula tour.&#xA0; Travel along the coastal road through the chic suburbs of Clifton, Camps Bay and onto the picturesque fishing community of Hout Bay.&#xA0; Next you enjoy a scenic drive along Chapman&#x2019;s Peak as it hugs the cliffside and continue south to reach Cape Point in the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve, said to be the romantic meeting point of two mighty oceans, the Atlantic and the Indian.&#xA0; Sir Francis Drake, the famous explorer, once called it "the fairest Cape that we saw in the whole circumference of the Globe."&#xA0; Returning along the Indian Ocean you stop to visit the unique penguin colonies at Boulders beach. Your drive meanders through the historic naval base of Simonstown and on to Kirstenbosch Botanical gardens nestled on the lower slopes of Table Mountain.&#xA0; Enjoy a relaxing walk through these lovely gardens where 4,000 of the 22,000 Southern African flowering plants are cultivated in a setting of mountain streams, pools and rolling lawns.&#xA0; In the late afternoon, you return to your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Cape Grace Hotel &#x2013; Luxury Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Cape Town - Winelands&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Your focus today during your private tour is South Africa&#x2019;s acclaimed Winelands.&#xA0; A combination of the favorable effects of the two major ocean currents meeting off the Cape makes the climate perfect for the acres of vineyards set is a stunning backdrop of the Hottentots Holland Mountains.&#xA0; The tree-lined streets and the white gabled Cape Dutch homesteads blend in tranquil harmony.&#xA0; Visit one of where it is easy to see why Simon Van Der Stel decided to build a village in such a charming spot.&#xA0; Walk up Dorp Street, one of the longest rows of old Cape Dutch buildings left in South Africa and then visit the Village Museum, a collection of preserved houses which gives an insight into the lives of the early settlers in Stellenbosch through to the Victorian era.&#xA0; Afterwards you enjoy a scenic drive over the majestic Helshoogte Pass to the charming village of Franschhoek for lunch and a little time for browsing in the galleries and shops.&#xA0; The origins of this charming and beautifully situated village date back to 1688 when French Huguenots fleeing religious persecution settled in the valley, which later became known as French Corner or 'Franschhoek' in Afrikaans.&#xA0; The tour ends with a visit to the magnificent manor house of Boschendal before returning to your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Cape Grace Hotel &#x2013; Luxury Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Cape Town / Sabi Sands Game Reserve &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you fly to Johannesburg, and connect with your Feral Air charter (seat-in-plane) to Sabi Sands Game Reserve. Please note that luggage allowance is strictly 44lbs per person in soft sided bags including all hand luggage such as camera equipment.&#xA0; On arrival at OR Tambo (Johannesburg) Airport you exit the terminal building.&#xA0; Turn left if you are exiting from International Arrivals and right if you are exiting from Domestic Arrivals.&#xA0; Follow the sign to the Car Rental Kiosk situated on Level 0 in the multi-story parkade and car rental hall.&#xA0; Walk past the Budget and Avis kiosks and turn right at the other end and proceed to the bus terminus behind the Intercontinental Hotel.&#xA0; The Federal Air booth is situated at Number 4.&#xA0; Here you are met by the Federal Air Guest Relations Representatives.&#xA0; You will then be transferred via scheduled shuttle to the Federal Air lounge where you check-in for your flight and where can relax until your plane departs.&#xA0; On arrival you are met and transferred by 4x4 open vehicle to your private game lodge.&#xA0; Singita is one of the world's finest, most exclusive safari lodges.&#xA0; Expert guiding is underpinned by fine cuisine, a superb cellar and unsurpassed service.&#xA0; Boulders Lodge has a contemporary African ambience with strong Eastern influences and the floor to ceiling glass walls bring the bush into the lodge.

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Sabi Sands Game Reserve&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you enjoy some of the game activities offered by the lodge.&#xA0; A safari is nearly always an important part of a holiday in Southern Africa.&#xA0; Few things can match the thrill of tracking a leopard on the hunt or observing a breeding herd of elephants at a waterhole.&#xA0; The Sabi Sands, the Timbavati and the Manyeleti private game reserves all share an open border with the Kruger so animals move freely.&#xA0; The 65,000 ha Sabi Sands is considered to have the best big five game viewing in the country.&#xA0; The Sand and the Sabie rivers supply much needed water to the region resulting in an incredible diversity of wildlife. Due to a long history of sensitive game-viewing practices here, the animals are mostly relaxed allowing superb game viewing. Even the elusive leopard has become accustomed to safari vehicles resulting in extraordinary close sightings.&#xA0; This is a unique feature of Sabi Sands.&#xA0; These reserves comprise a number of private game lodges, whose owners cooperate in conserving their valuable heritage.&#xA0; Some of the world's finest game lodges are found here, together with some less well-known bush camps.&#xA0; This is an intimate and informative experience.&#xA0; You enjoy game drives in open-vehicle with an experienced ranger and a local Shangaan tracker, who work together to give you a deeper understanding of the wildlife and the natural cycles of the bush.&#xA0; Drives are in the early morning and late afternoon when game is most likely to be active. Tracking Africa's big game, set out for an evening safari after afternoon tea.&#xA0; Enjoy a bush sunset as you anticipate the journey into the night, searching for the rare and elusive nocturnal species.&#xA0; The evening meal is often enjoyed in a 'boma' or even in the bush around an open fire, which many guests feel is a particularly evocative treat.&#xA0; Morning walks are encouraged ensuring that the more fascinating aspects of the fauna and flora are not overlooked.&#xA0; Game walks offer the ultimate, close-to-the-wild experience, and a chance to focus on the smaller bush inhabitants.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Singita Boulders &#x2013; Suite (Fully Inclusive)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Sabi Sands Game Reserve / Kruger National Park&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning you enjoy a short charter flight (seat in plane) from Singita Sabi Sands to Singita Sweni, a private concession within the Kruger.&#xA0; Singita Sweni is located in a private 15,000-hectare concession in the central Kruger National Park (Sweni and Lebombo are collectively known as Singita Kruger).&#xA0; They lie in the foothills of the Lebombo Mountains and form the eastern edge of the Kruger National Park.&#xA0; Singita Sweni is in a beautiful shaded riverside setting.&#xA0; Singita Sweni has ultra-stylish, modern architecture and design, yet, it maintains an intimate authentic safari ambience.&#xA0; This is partly due to its stunning river setting - you are right in the bush with close-up animal and bird sightings - but also because there are only six suites at Sweni.&#xA0; The public areas all overlook the river with sounds of snorting hippos and birds ever present.&#xA0; There's a sitting area with fireplace for the winter mornings and evenings and a dining room with moveable glass walls which can be left open, or closed in the evenings in the cooler winter months.&#xA0; To the side is the secluded swimming pool and pool deck with glorious river views.&#xA0; The six glass-enclosed suites fan are simply glorious.&#xA0; They are modern in style using soft safari colors and stylish furniture.&#xA0; There's a decadent open plan bathroom, indoor and outdoor showers and a large game-viewing deck with your own day bed.&#xA0; Other amenities include air-conditioning, ceiling fan, minibar, safe and telephone.&#xA0; Singita Sweni offers excellent game viewing with the emphasis placed on encountering large herds of plains game than on individual predator sightings.&#xA0; It is particularly known for its excellent lion sightings with two large prides in the concession.&#xA0; Given the varying terrain of this part of the Kruger and the private game reserves of the Sabi Sands or Timbavati, time and budget permitting you might like to combine two nights here with two nights at Singita Ebony or Boulders.&#xA0; It offers a range of active activities as well as 4x4 game drives.&#xA0; Within walking distance of Singita Sweni is the Trading Post with its stylish African craft boutiques, well-equipped gym and spa. Huge glass walls bring the bush feel right into the gym and spa with its range of treatment rooms, steam room and outdoor shower.&#xA0; This area offers a perfect way to spend a couple of hours in between game activities.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Singita Sweni &#x2013; Suite (Fully Inclusive)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; Kruger National Park&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
The Royal Livingstone Hotel is an elegant five-star hotel in an unrivalled setting overlooking the falls.&#xA0; The 173 rooms, with their hand-carved mahogany furniture, have an African feel with eastern overtones.&#xA0; All have a balcony or patio with views of the mature acacia trees, lawns and river.&#xA0; The hotel has a superb restaurant, large pool, pool bar and small casino.&#xA0; A splendid large wooden deck affords sweeping views of the falls, ideal for cocktails at sunset.&#xA0; As the hotel is actually in the Zambezi National Park, park fees are included in the hotel's rates and so you can visit the falls as much as you would like during your stay.&#xA0; Massages can either be enjoyed outside with a view over the river, or in the privacy of your room.&#xA0; The Victoria Falls is a dramatic scenic contrast and a change of pace from the private game reserves.&#xA0; The clouds of spray generated by this thunderous descent have resulted in a lush rain forest full of stunning wild flowers and the most spectacular views of the falls are from the Zambian side of the gorge (depending on the season).&#xA0; The recommended season for experiencing Victoria Falls from the Zambian side is January to August, with the peak months being May, June and July when the falls are the highest.&#xA0; (If traveling between October and December, we recommend taking a tour of the falls from the Zimbabwean side, taking a helicopter excursion or visiting Livingstone Island as well.)&#xA0; Activities available there include canoeing, languorous sunset river cruises on the tranquil Upper Zambezi above the falls, helicopter 'Flight of Angels' rides, micro light flights, bungee jumping and whitewater rafting.&#xA0; Game drives and horse riding are also offered in the Zambezi National Park to view elephant and buffalo and even the newly relocated rhino.&#xA0; Visitors can also sample elephant back safaris at Thorntree Lodge.&#xA0; This afternoon enjoy a sundowner&#x2019;s cruise on the Zambezi River.&#xA0; Guests are met by staff from the African Queen cruise boat and driven to the 'Royal Landing' jetty on the Zambezi River for boarding.&#xA0; The African Queen meanders slowly upstream along the length of the Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park looking for game on the way.&#xA0; A number of animals and a host of bird species can be viewed from comfortable chairs on cool wooden decks.&#xA0; Excellent hot and cold food is served on board and the bar is well stocked with spirits, good wines, beers and soft drinks.&#xA0; The African Queen is a five-star boat, a triple deck 70ft catamaran furnished in Rhodesian teak, beech wood and brass.&#xA0; Pick up is at 3:30pm from May to August (winter) and 4:00pm from September to April (summer) with the boat departing at 4:00pm, or 4:30pm, respectively from the Royal Landing.&#xA0; The cruise lasts for 2 hours and includes hot and cold snacks, drinks and transfers. Guests are usually back at the resort at about 6:30pm in the winter and 7:00pm in the summer.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Royal Livingstone Hotel &#x2013; Luxury Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11:&#xA0; Victoria Falls &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning you enjoy an awe-inspiring tour which takes the form of a walk in the natural rainforest to the Victoria Falls.&#xA0; A knowledgeable and informative local guide accompanies you. Victoria Falls is one of the most spectacular natural sights in the world.&#xA0; Livingstone Island lies perched right on the very edge of Victoria Falls in the very midst of this thundering mass of water, and is about as close as you can imagine to the Victoria Falls. Livingstone Island is the place from where Dr Livingstone first viewed the Mosi-oa-Tunya ('the Smoke That Thunders').&#xA0; He was paddled in a dugout canoe but today visitors are picked up from the Royal Livingstone jetty and a skilled skipper re-traces Livingstone's approach to the island which is on the very edge of Victoria Falls.&#xA0; All visits to the island are during the 'low water' season, which usually begins in mid July and goes through to the end of January.&#xA0; (High water visits are not possible.)&#xA0; Five visits are offered daily with a maximum of 16 people per visit.&#xA0; On arrival you will be taken on a guided exploration of the island:&#xA0; learning about its long history, from ancient times when it was a sacrificial site, to the present day, as a protected World Heritage Site.&#xA0; You can take photos of the Victoria Falls from this extraordinary angle and the very intrepid can even take a heart-stopping peek over the island's edge to the churning mass below.&#xA0; After the tour, you can relax and enjoy afternoon tea under the shade of our canopied dining area with a view of the falls that is quite unique.&#xA0; For those of you who are keen on a swimming experience unlike any other, you can even brave the waters of this mighty river in the island's very own bathing pool, which forms each year amongst the rocks along the edge of the falls.&#xA0; (Only possible in extreme low water from October to January, and better for the morning tour.)&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Royal Livingstone Hotel &#x2013; Luxury Room (B) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day12:&#xA0; Victoria Falls / Johannesburg, South Africa / Depart&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you will be transferred from your hotel to the airport in time to board your scheduled flight to Johannesburg, where you will have access to the Rennies lounge during your connection to your international departure flight home.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt; (B)&lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

&lt;/ul&gt;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Nairobi, Kenya&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome this evening to Africa&#x2019;s safari hub!&#xA0; Your guide escorts you to the legendary Norfolk Hotel.&#xA0; Opened on Christmas Day, 1904, this hotel has hosted the famous and infamous.&#xA0; From its verandas, you can imagine Teddy Roosevelt and Ernest Hemingway mapping out their historic safaris.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Norfolk Hotel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Nairobi&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&#x201C;I had a farm in Africa, at the foot of the Ngong Hills.&#x201D;&#xA0; So begins Out of Africa by Isak Dinesen (Baroness Karen von Blixen), who showed us a world of romance, daring, struggle and triumph in Kenya during the early part of the 20th century.&#xA0; From her cottage, you glimpse her beloved hills.&#xA0; At the Giraffe Centre, you come eye to eye with rare Rothschild giraffes.&#xA0; Tonight&#x2019;s briefing prepares you for your safari tomorrow.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Norfolk Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Nairobi / Serengeti National Park, Tanzania&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, two flights take you to the splendid Serengeti Plains, where the world's last mass animal migration plays out annually.&#xA0; Hundreds of thousands of mostly wildebeest and zebra move in columns snaking to the horizon.&#xA0; And, predators are always nearby.&#xA0; Your first tented camp rests at the heart of prime wildlife theaters on the Serengeti, where game viewing is good year-round.&#xA0; The days on safari fall into a wonderfully dreamy rhythm &#x2013; morning and afternoon games drivers, safari luncheons, lantern-lit bush suppers and conversations and cocktails by the camp fire.&#xA0; What makes this camp unique is that it is a mobile camp, moving to both ends of the Serengeti mid-year to ensure prime location for premier game viewing opportunities.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Olakira Camp&#xA0;/ Soroi Camp&#xA0;(B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Serengeti National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Few things equal the thrill of sharing these wide, open spaces with antelope, giraffe, wildebeest, cheetah, elephant, leopard, buffalo, zebra, warthog, hippo and crocodile.&#xA0; Watch the extraordinary interplay between species, such as hyenas hovering just out of reach of lions.&#xA0; Bird watching enthusiasts can scout for some of the 500 species here.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Olakira Camp&#xA0;/ Soroi Camp&#xA0;(B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Serengeti National Park / Ngorongoro Crater&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, you head towards the Ngorongoro Crater Conservation area.&#xA0; Step back into the Stone Age at Olduvai Gorge, where Louis and Mary Leakey discovered abundant fossils dating back over two million years.&#xA0; Continue to the crater and your lodge located on its rim.&#xA0; The impressive caldera descends 2,000 feet to the 102-square-mile basin.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ngorongoro Sopa Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Ngorongoro Crater / Ngorongoro Highlands&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Begin this exquisite day with a descent along a rocky track into the caldera, the result of an ancient volcano.&#xA0; More than 30,000 animals that inhabit the crater floor, including buffalo, rhino, wildebeest, gazelle, zebra, reedbuck, and Africa&#x2019;s highest concentration of lion.&#xA0; Flamingo, royal crowned crane and the comical secretary bird are among the 350 bird species found here.&#xA0; Sit down to a picnic lunch in this unforgettable setting.&#xA0; After leaving the crater floor, continue on to your accommodations at the elegant and welcoming, up country farm home in the Cape Dutch style of architecture.&#xA0;&#xA0;Relax and dine in an atmosphere of old-world graciousness.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Manor at Ngorongoro (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Ngorongoro Highlands / Lake Manyara National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Enjoy an excursion to Lake Manyara at the foot of an escarpment of the Great Rift Valley.&#xA0; This small park supports a surprising array of animals, including the largest concentration of elephants in East Africa.&#xA0; You may spot one of the park&#x2019;s famed tree-climbing lions that seek shade high in the acacia branches.&#xA0; Return to your estate later today.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Manor at Ngorongoro (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8: &#xA0;Ngorongoro Highlands / Satao Elerai Conservancy (Amboseli), Kenya&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Enjoy lunch in Arusha before traveling back to Kenya and your exclusive camp located on the Eastern side of Amboseli National Park in its own private conservancy, the Satao Elerai Conservancy that protects more than 5,000 acres of natural wildlife area.&#xA0; The camp was built to ensure the local Maasai community benefit from the economic incentives to set aside their land for wildlife conservation.&#xA0; The Satao Elerai Conservancy forms a critical wildlife corridor linking the Kilimanjaro Forest Reserve in Tanzania and the Amboseli National Park.&#xA0; The Conservancy is a project between the privately and community owned camp, the African Wildlife Foundation and the local Maasai Elerai community.&#xA0; The camp is comprised of five luxury suites and nine charming canvas tents.&#xA0; The gorgeous lodge style suites feature gently sloping organic walls, built with natural rocks, acacia wood and a carefully constructed thatched roof; large sliding doors open up to a private verandah overlooking the plains of Elerai Conservancy and the Amboseli National Park.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Satao Elerai (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; Satao Elerai Conservancy&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Enjoy the activities around your camp.&#xA0; Morning and afternoon game drives are within the conservancy area to insure a private and exclusive safari experience with a very low vehicle density.&#xA0; Head into the Amboseli National Park to see the vast herds of elephants.&#xA0; Night game drives offer a whole different atmosphere and feel of the bush, searching for the more secretive and elusive nocturnal animals.&#xA0; Walking through the African savannah with a Maasai tracker offers another new dimension to game viewing.&#xA0; Come close to the different species of flora and fauna that are part of the Amboseli ecosystem while slowly approaching plains game such as zebra, impalas, or even the great eland, and you may catch a glimpse of a warthog running fast away on its short, fat legs.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Satao Elerai (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10:&#xA0; Satao Elerai Conservancy / Lewa Wildlife Conservancy&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Fly to Nairobi, and connect with your flight to Lewa Downs.&#xA0; Lewa Safari Camp featuring outstanding game viewing, and spectacular views to Mt. Kenya to the south and arid lowlands to the north.&#xA0; The camp is based within the private 65,000-acre wildlife conservancy of the Lewa Wilderness Trust, and is home to about 10 percent of Kenya's black rhino population and the single largest population of Grevy's zebra in the world.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Lewa Safari Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11:&#xA0; Lewa Wildlife Conservancy&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Spend the day enjoying tailored activities including game viewing in four-wheel drive vehicles, escorted horseback rides amongst the plains animals, and local walks.&#xA0; You can learn to read animal spoor and approach game on foot for exciting pictures.&#xA0; There is even a prehistoric site on the ranch where rough-hewn Acheulian hand axes have been found scattered on the ground, perhaps a half million years old.&#xA0; Animals at Lewa include elephant, numerous reticulated giraffe, eland, lion, leopard, cheetah, Burchell&#x2019;s and Grevy&#x2019;s zebra, Jackson&#x2019;s hartebeest, greater kudu, Grant&#x2019;s gazelle, impala, gerenuk, bushbuck, dikdik and many others.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Lewa Safari Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day&#xA0;12:&#xA0; Lewa Wildlife Conservancy / Olare Orok Conservancy (Masai Mara)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Enjoy the panorama of the Great Rift Valley from the window of your plane as you wing your way to the Masai Mara Game Reserve, Kenya's most precious wildlife sanctuary.&#xA0; On arrival, you are transferred to your camp, one of just three camps currently operating within this conservancy, which boasts the region&#x2019;s lowest vehicle density; no mini-buses and only one guest room per 700 acres.&#xA0; Here, you avoid the high tourist density of the Masai Mara Game Reserve while retaining the diversity of wildlife. Until recently, Olare Orok&#x2019;s 30,000 acres of prime rolling grasslands and riverine forest were filled with rural homesteads and large herds of cattle and goats.&#xA0; The ecosystem was being overgrazed, risking the sustenance of both wildlife and cattle, and to the detriment of both.&#xA0; Sustainability was at risk for both the people and the wildlife.&#xA0; Today, the homesteads, cattle and goats have moved, and herd sizes have been reduced accordingly.&#xA0; The conservancy has become a haven for big cats, a route of migration and now offers some of East Africa's finest year-round game viewing.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Mara Plains Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 13 &amp;amp; 14:&#xA0; Masai Mara Game Reserve&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;During morning and afternoon game drives, you explore savannas spotted with herds of buffalo, wildebeest, hartebeest, impala and gazelle.&#xA0; Dense thorn bush may hide browsing black rhino, and large numbers of giraffe and elephant patrol the edge of the woods.&#xA0; Hippos gather in the Mara River.&#xA0; Here, lion prides may be up to 20 strong.&#xA0; Night game drives offer a whole different atmosphere and feel of the bush as your search the darkness for elusive nocturnal species.&#xA0; Walking safaris are permitted in the conservancy, which is not true of the national parks.&#xA0; Walking the savannah in the company of a Maasai tracker gives you an entirely new experience of the African bush.&#xA0; If desired, you are also welcome to visit the Koiyaki Guide School, the only guide school in the region allowing young Maasai warriors an opportunity to enter the tourism industry, while allowing the young man to continue the traditions of his community.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Mara Plains Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 15:&#xA0; Masai Mara Game Reserve / Nairobi / Depart&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After an early game drive, you fly over the Great Rift Valley back to Nairobi, and transfer to your welcoming hotel.&#xA0; Late morning, you visit the David SheldrickWildlife Trust&#x2019;s Elephant and Rhino Orphanage, an amazing experience showcasing this organization's efforts to save young elephants and rhinos orphaned by poachers. &#xA0;This afternoon, enjoy a city tour through the shopping center and colorful bazaar to Parliament Buildings, Kenyatta Conference Center, the Railway Museum, Uhuru Park, and onto the National Museum, once described as "The Finest Small Museum in Africa."&#xA0; This evening, savor a gala farewell dinner.&#xA0; Then, you bid &#x201C;Kwaheri&#x201D; (a Swahili goodbye).&#xA0; After check-in at the airport, you have time for last-minute shopping near your departure gate.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ole Sereni - Dayroom (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

&lt;/strong&gt;On arrival at OR Tambo (Johannesburg) airport, look for our representative, who will be holding a name-board with your surname on it.&#xA0; Your driver will transfer you from the airport to your hotel.&#xA0; Known to the locals as "E'Goli" or City of Gold, Johannesburg is the pulsating heart of South Africa's industrial and commercial life where gold mining still continues.&#xA0; The Westcliff Hotel has a stunning setting on a ridge overlooking the leafy, northern suburbs and Zoological gardens of Johannesburg.&#xA0;&#xA0;The Westcliff offers the best of both worlds in that you hardly feel like you are in a city, such is the sense of space and tranquillity, and yet complimentary shuttles are provided to nearby restaurants and shopping. &#xA0;The Westcliff is set on several terraces reminiscent of an Italianate hillside village, within seven acres of landscaped gardens.&#xA0; The glamorous pool terrace with its heated infinity swimming pool offers a reviving escape from the city bustle - the perfect place for evening cocktails.&#xA0; Other facilities include tennis courts, health and beauty spa and a second more secluded swimming pool. &#xA0;All of The Westcliff's 178 spacious rooms and suites are finely decorated and offer air-conditioning, TV, video, Internet access, and mini bar.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Westcliff Hotel &#x2013; Junior Suite&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Johannesburg / Victoria Falls, Zambia&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Our representative will collect you from your hotel and transfer you to the airport for your scheduled flight to Victoria Falls.&#xA0; On arrival at Livingstone Airport, our representative will be waiting to greet you, by holding a name-board with your surname on it.&#xA0; You will have a private transfer from the airport to your hotel.&#xA0; Victoria Falls is a dramatic scenic contrast and a change of pace from the private game reserves.&#xA0; The clouds of spray generated by this thunderous descent have helped create a lush rain forest full of stunning wild flowers. &#xA0;The most spectacular views of the falls are from the Zambian side of the gorge (depending on the season).&#xA0; Adventure activities abound at the falls.&#xA0; Canoe the fabled Zambezi River; enjoy a languorous sunset river cruises on the tranquil Upper Zambezi above the falls; or ride high above the falls either by&#xA0;helicopter, called 'Flight of Angels, 'or by micro-lite for some of the most stunning views you will ever see.&#xA0; Bungee jumping and white-water rafting are available as are game drives, and horseback riding in the Zambezi National Park to view elephant, giraffe, buffalo and even the newly relocated rhino.&#xA0; The best time to view the falls is probably between April/May and August when the spray is less yet the flow of water is still impressive.&#xA0; As the dry season progresses, the volume of water over the falls declines quite dramatically.&#xA0; Visitors in late September to December need to be aware of this, and we recommend that you book a helicopter trip or a micro-lite flight over the falls so that you can enjoy the full landscape of the falls.&#xA0; This afternoon, you are met by staff from the African Queen, a five-star, triple-deck 70-foot catamaran furnished in Rhodesian teak, beech wood and brass.&#xA0; You are driven to the 'Royal Landing' jetty on the Zambezi River to board the cruise boat, which meanders slowly upstream along the length of the Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, looking for animals and birds from comfortable chairs on cool wooden decks.&#xA0; Excellent hot and cold food is served on board and the bar is well stocked with spirits, wines, beers and soft drinks.&#xA0; The two-hour cruise includes hot and cold snacks, drinks and transfers.&#xA0; The Royal Livingstone Hotel is an elegant five-star hotel in an unrivalled setting overlooking the falls.&#xA0; The 173 rooms include hand-carved mahogany furniture, and have an African feel with eastern overtones.&#xA0; All have a balcony or patio with views of the mature acacia trees, lawns and river.&#xA0; The hotel has a superb restaurant, large pool (which seems almost in the Zambezi), pool bar and small casino.&#xA0; A splendid large wooden deck affords sweeping views of the falls, ideal for cocktails at sunset.&#xA0; The hotel is actually in the Zambezi National Park, which means park fees are included in the hotel's rates, so you can visit the falls as much as you would like during your stay.&#xA0; The range of excursions that can be booked by the hotel include sunset boat cruises, local village tours, game drives, helicopter flips and various adventure options.&#xA0; Manicures and pedicures can be arranged in-room and massages can either be enjoyed outside with a view over the river, or in the privacy of your room.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Royal Livingstone Hotel - Luxury Room (B) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Victoria Falls&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you will savor a private tour of Victoria Falls followed by a visit to Chief Mukuni's village.&#xA0; Walk in the natural rainforest to the phenomenal Victoria Falls with your knowledgeable and informative local guide.&#xA0; Next you head to Chief Mukuni's village which was founded as Gundu in the 13th century, and later named after the ruler (Mukuni) on arrival from the Congo.&#xA0; It is home to the Leya people.&#xA0; This tour presents an opportunity to see how local people live in a real African village with a population of 7,000, a clinic, basic school and boreholes for drinking water.&#xA0; Visitors see how huts are built and decorated, meet residents and see local artisans and crafters work creating curios.&#xA0; Please realize that this is a working village and not one built as an example for tourists. &#xA0;That may mean that you will get an accurate, and sometimes uncomfortable, glimpse of life in an African village today. &#xA0;The recommended season for seeing the Victoria Falls is January to September as the Victoria Falls on the Zambian side sometime dry up from October onwards.&#xA0; (If travelling from October to December, we recommend either a tour of the falls from the Zimbabwe side, taking a helicopter excursion or visiting Livingstone Island as well.)&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Royal Livingstone Hotel - Luxury Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Victoria Falls / Linyanti Game Reserve, Botswana&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today you are driven to Kasane Airport for your charter flight to your game lodge.&#xA0; You are met and transferred by light charter flight (seat in plane) from Kasane Airport to your game lodge in the Linyanti Swamps.&#xD;
&#xD;
(&lt;em&gt;Please note that luggage allowance is strictly 44Lbs per person in soft squashy bags including all hand luggage such as camera equipment.)&lt;/em&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
The Linyanti Swamps, west of Chobe National Park, are wilder and also known for the large elephant herds.&#xA0; Huge African ebony and marula trees, a favorite food of elephants, shade the rivers.&#xA0; This is big game country, with predators such as lion, cheetah, wild dog and hyena regularly sighted, as well as herds of impala, lechwe, kudu, zebra, giraffe, sable, roan, waterbuck and buffalo. &#xA0;The landscape is characterized by grassland vistas dotted with palm forest islands. &#xA0;The three good private concessions here - Kwando, Selinda and Linyanti - offer a seasonal home to game migrating from the grasslands to the south, with the permanent water of the Linyanti/Kwando River drawing the animals during the dry season. &#xA0;The Selinda Reserve is the domain of the big cats and game-viewing is both private and riveting.&#xA0; Here, Zarafa Camp is blessed with an extraordinary location in the eastern sector of the Selinda Reserve overlooking the vast savannas and floodplains of the Zibadianja Lagoon under cool and shady Jackalberry forests. &#xA0;Zarafa has just four large and luxuriously appointed double or twin 'marquis style' tents.&#xA0; Each tented rooms is close to 1,000 square feet, and is positioned along the edge of the forests to take advantage of the spectacular view over the floodplains and savannas.&#xA0; Each tent has a spacious bedroom with en-suite bathroom with indoor and outdoor showers. &#xA0;Outside is a large deck with private pool.&#xA0; Overhead fans, flowing and seductive mosquito nets, and a beautiful handcrafted copper fireplace, strategically placed between the bathroom and bedroom for the winter months, complete the picture.&#xA0; The furniture has been handcrafted and is made from recycled ancient hardwoods.&#xA0; Outside is a large deck with private pool.&#xA0; The camp is solar powered, and the electricity generation system coupled with stringent use of recycled hardwoods and careful operating processes throughout the camp make this one of the "greenest" camps on the planet, and to keep carbon and emissions footprint at the minimum.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Zarafa Camp - Luxury Tent (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Linyanti Game Reserve&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Activities at Zarafa Camp are not regimented.&#xA0; Inevitably though, your activities are driven by the best game viewing times, the animal movements, or the weather.&#xA0; Wildlife and nature drives often start at dawn because this is the best time and when the predators are active.&#xA0; You usually return mid to late morning for brunch, and head out again in the mid to late afternoon.&#xA0; The midday siesta time can be spent at one of Zarafa's waterholes in an elevated hide.&#xA0; Short walks from camp with our fully qualified guides are also offered.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Zarafa Camp &#x2013; Luxury Tent (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Linyanti Game Reserve / Makgadikgadi Pans&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;You are transferred by light charter flight (seat in plane) from your Linyanti game lodge to Jack's Camp via Maun airport.&#xA0; On arrival, you are met and transferred to the camp by 4x4 vehicle.&#xA0; Jack's Camp harks back to a classic 1940s safari camp.&#xA0; This romantic camp is about as remote as you can get. &#xA0;Yet no visit to Botswana can be said to be truly complete without experiencing the desert as well as the delta.&#xA0; Ten tents, complete with Persian carpets, canvas washbasins, paraffin lamps, even a wind-up gramophone, are idyllically set on a tree and palm covered island in the vast golden grasslands. &#xA0;En suite facilities offer indoor and outdoor showers and flush toilets.&#xA0; Dining is in the mess tent, or al fresco under the stars, whilst the tea tent, with cushions and a wind-up gramophone, is ideal for decadent afternoon teas.&#xA0; This stylish camp offers a traditional safari experience and a holistic understanding of Botswana's wildlife, geography, geology and its people, both past and present, including the nomadic Bushmen.&#xA0; The Makgadikgadi Salt Pans are the legacy of a great lake, larger than Lake Victoria, which once covered most of Southern Botswana about two million years ago. &#xA0;Vast shallow white pans make up an extraordinary landscape, deceptively animated by mirages that shimmer and dance in the heat-blasted air.&#xA0; However when rains come in the summer the pans are transformed into shallow lakes and attract spectacular bird life including flamingos, pelicans and cranes - a majestic spectacle after especially good rains.&#xA0; The summer rains attract the last surviving migration of wildebeest and zebra in Southern Africa to the surrounding sweet summer grasses.&#xA0; In the dry season they move to the east returning to the pans in the rainy season. &#xA0;In addition there are rare brown hyenas as well as springbok, gemsbok, red hartebeest and the predators that follow them.&#xA0; After the rains (December to April), there can be enormous herds of wildebeest, zebra and Springbok (with the accompanying predators) on the open grasslands.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Jack's Camp - Standard Tent&#xA0;(B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 7 &amp;amp; 8: &#xA0;Makgadikgadi Pans&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Activities are conducted in 4x4 vehicles, custom designed to suit this terrain, by knowledgeable guides.&#xA0; Only in the dry winter months are all-purpose ATV vehicles (quad-bikes) available, allowing guests to visit the saltpans. &#xA0;(This activity takes place every third day so a three night stay is recommended.)&#xA0; Walks with Bushman trackers, mornings spent with meerkats and visits to historical baobab trees used as camp sites by Livingstone and Selous are other activities.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Jack's Camp - Standard Tent&#xA0;(B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; Makgadikgadi Pans / Johannesburg, South Africa&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;You are met and transferred by light charter flight (seat in plane) from Tsigaro (Jack's Camp San Camp and Camp Kalahari) to Maun Airport where you board your scheduled flight back to Johannesburg.&#xA0; On arrival at OR Tambo (Johannesburg) airport, look out for our representative, holding a name-board with your surname on it. &#xA0;They will transfer you from the airport to your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The&#xA0;Westcliff Hotel &#x2013; Junior Suite (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

This sprawling 'city within a city' is home to approximately 2-million people.&#xA0; You are dropped off at OR Tambo Airport for your charter flight (seat in plane).&#xA0; On arrival, you are met and transferred by 4x4 open vehicle to your private game lodge set in Madikwe, which offers exclusivity, privacy and excellent service. &#xA0;The lodge has just five suites available in the rocky outcrops of Gabbro Hills. &#xA0;Here, you can relax in your private infinity pool at your suite and enjoy spectacular views over the surrounding plains and the waterhole. &#xA0;Each thatched suite is air-conditioned and is designed to be part of a radial configuration around one of the hills.&#xA0; Custom built 4x4 game drive vehicles give you the opportunity to view the Madikwe area over vast distances, or take a guided bush walk where Mateya's specialist rangers and trackers take you to experience game and wildlife up close. &#xA0;The malaria-free Madikwe has been successfully restocked through a program that reintroduced over 10 000 animals over the last few years, all indigenous to the area.&#xA0; The 75,000-hectare private reserve now boasts a healthy wildlife population including the 'Big Five' and over 340 recorded bird species.&#xA0; You can also expect to see its packs of wild dog which are regularly sighted as well as Black and White rhino, extensive plains game, including sable, gemsbok, springbok and giraffe.&#xA0; Morning and evening game drives with experienced game rangers will allow time in the middle of the day for relaxation in the comfort and luxury of the lodge.&#xA0; In the late afternoon, set out on a game drive that continues after dark.&#xA0; At least one, if not all of your evening meals are likely to be enjoyed in an open 'boma', under the stars around an open fire.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Mateya Safari Lodge - Luxury Thatched Chalet (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>Tanzania &amp; Kenya:  The Challenge and the Promise</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&#x201C;My first safari was in the Masai Mara at the age of 2; I lost my first baby tooth at Lake Baringo; and climbed Mt Kilimanjaro at the age of 14.&#xA0; So, my idea of the ultimate safari is probably different from what most would expect.&#xA0; Safaris, in my opinion, go beyond simply excellent game drives.&#xA0;&#xA0;They are about changing your life, about finding yourself, and about connecting with local communities.&#xA0; This journey is designed to meet those challenges head on.&#xA0; From climbing to the rooftop of Africa, to spending a night in its crater, to connecting with Maasai tribes in the most authentic settings in the private conservancies of Kenya, this safari is designed to change your life.&#xA0; With private charter flights throughout the safari, reaching the far corners of the East African plains has never been easier."&#xA0;&#xA0;Ashish Sanghrajka, President&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Be among the few to climb Africa&#x2019;s highest mountain, Kilimanjaro, at some 19,342 feet&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;Savor a more personal , authentic safari experience in the uncrowded private Olare Orok Conservancy bordering the famed Masai Mara Game Reserve&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;Set out on night game drives for a completely different atmosphere as you search the shadows for nocturnal species&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;div&gt;Take the opportunity to walk through the African savannah with a Maasai tracker&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;Fly to Chyulu Hills and your camp, Ol Donyo Lodge, set in a 275,000-acre, Maasai-owned ranch where you track the "Big Five" &#x2013; rhino, elephant, lion, leopard and buffalo&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;Today is a short trek designed to help you acclimatize.&#xA0; A smaller track leads off the main trail through the moorland and towards Mawenzi&#x2019;s steeply rising slopes.&#xA0; The trekking time is about three to five hours, arriving in camp for a hot lunch, and a chance to continue to acclimatize while exploring the surrounding landscape of bizarre plants and rock formations and caves.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Kikelewa Caves Camp (B,L,D&lt;/strong&gt;)&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Kikelewa Caves Camp / Mawenzi Tarn Camp (14,160 ft. / 4,315 m)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today, you trek from the moorland into the stark highland desert towards Mawenzi.&#xA0; These trails are not frequented by many tourists.&#xA0; From the Tarn Campsite you will enjoy magnificent views across the saddle towards Kibo &#x2013; your final target.&#xA0; Total trekking time is four to seven hours.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Mawenzi Tarn Camp (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Mawenzi Tarn Camp / Outward&#xA0;Bound Camp (15,585 ft. / 4,750 m)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;The trekking time today is five to seven hours during&#xA0; a relatively easy hike across the wide saddle between Mawenzi and Kibo.&#xA0; The trek takes you across the massive saddle.&#xA0; The crossing is impressive and the landscape spectacularly stark.&#xA0; Prepare all your gear for the next day ahead, and turn in early.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Outward Bound Camp (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; Outward&#xA0;Bound Camp / Uhuru Peak (19,340 ft. / 5,895 m)&#xA0; / Crater Camp (18,800 ft. / 5,730 m)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;A 5am wake-up call is the start of an intense day of trekking, beginning by trekking up a winding path.&#xA0; From your camp to the rim of the crater, Gillman&#x2019;s Point (18,750 ft. / 5,712 m), to Uhuru Peak takes about seven to eight hours.&#xA0; The slope is steep, and follows switchbacks over loose rock and scree with some boulders as you near Gilman&#x2019;s Point.&#xA0; Stop at Hans Meyer Cave on the way.&#xA0; Once you arrive at Gilman&#x2019;s Point, the trail to the summit is less demanding.&#xA0; You have another one-to two-hour walk along the snowy crater rim (depending on the season).&#xA0; Arrive at the summit in the early afternoon.&#xA0; There are no other travelers there at that time.&#xA0; From the summit, it is a short descent down into Crater Camp.&#xA0; The camp is set in soft sands near the retreating vertical ice walls of the Furtwangler Glacier.&#xA0; Rest and enjoy snacks and hot drinks in the mess tent.&#xA0; Opt to explore the strange landscapes of the inner crater, visit Reusch Crater, the ash pit, and the glaciers.&#xA0; You are among the very few who ever experience the summit zone of Kilimanjaro in this way.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt; Crater Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; Crater Camp / Horombo Camp (10,200 ft. / 3,110 m)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Trek across the crater floor's lunar landscape to Gilman&#x2019;s Point.&#xA0; A steep decent takes you to&#xA0;Kibo hut, about&#xA0;three hours, where you pause to rest and eat before setting out on another three-to four-hour walk to reach Horombo Camp.&#xA0; The trekking time from Crater Camp to Horombo camp.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Horombo Camp (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10:&#xA0; Horombo Camp / Marangu Gate (5,900 ft. / 1,800 m) / Arusha&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Descend straight to the gate, between five and six hours, where you&#x2019;ll have lunch and will be awarded climbing certificates.&#xA0; Transfer back to Arusha for a much-welcomed shower and restful night.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Arusha Coffee Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11:&#xA0; Arusha / Nairobi / Olare Orok Conservancy (Masai Mara)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Transfer to Kilimanjaro Airport this morning and board your private Cessna 402 from Kilimanjaro Airport to Nairobi&#x2019;s Wilson Airport.&#xA0; Clear immigration and customs before continuing on your private flight to the Olare Orok Conservancy, bordering the Masai Mara Game Reserve.&#xA0; Enjoy the panoramas of the Great Rift Valley from the window of your plane as you wing your way to the Masai Mara Game Reserve, Kenya's most precious wildlife sanctuary.&#xA0;&#xA0;On arrival at the Olare Orok airstrip, you are transferred to your camp, one of just three camps operating within the conservancy.&#xA0;&#xA0;With only one guest room per 700 acres, the conservancy boasts the region's lowest vehicle density, which means you avoid the large number of minibuses and people that can be found in the main areas of Masai Mara Game Reserve.&#xA0; You enjoy a more authentic safari experience.&#xA0; Until recently, Olare Orok&#x2019;s 30,000 acres of prime rolling grasslands and riverine forest were filled with rural homesteads and large herds of cattle and goats.&#xA0; The ecosystem was being overgrazed, risking the sustenance of both wildlife and cattle.&#xA0; Sustainability was at risk for the land, people and wildlife.&#xA0; Today, the homesteads, cattle and goats have moved, and herd sizes have been reduced accordingly.&#xA0; The conservancy has become a haven for big cats, a migration route that now offers some of East Africa's finest year-round game viewing.&#xA0; Nature walks and night game drives are a bonus here as these activities are not allowed in national game reserves.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Mara Plains Camp (B,L,D) &#x2013; Private Vehicle&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 12:&#xA0; Olare Orok Conservancy (Masai Mara)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;During morning and afternoon game drives, you explore savannas spotted with herds of buffalo, wildebeest, hartebeest, impala and gazelle.&#xA0; Dense thorn bush may hide browsing black rhino, and large numbers of giraffe and elephant patrol the edge of the woods.&#xA0; Hippos gather in the Mara River.&#xA0; Here, lion prides may be up to 20 strong.&#xA0; Night game drives offer a completely different atmosphere as you search the shadows for nocturnal species.&#xA0; By the same token, you have the opportunity to walk through the African savannah with a Maasai tracker for an entirely new dimension to game viewing.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Mara Plains Camp (B,L,D) &#x2013; Private Vehicle&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 13:&#xA0; Olare Orok Conservancy / Chyulu Hills (Amboseli)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, return to the Olare Orok airstrip where a private Cessna 402 has arrived to fly you to the ranges of the Chyulu Hills.&#xA0; Your camp, Ol Donyo Lodge, and private airstrip are set in a 275,000-acre, Maasai-owned Mbirikani Group Ranch located between Amboseli, Chyulu, Tsavo and Kilimanjaro National Parks.&#xA0; Ol Donyo Lodge&#x2019;s living and dining area manages to be spacious and intimate at the same time.&#xA0; The entire main area is set high on the hillside, and opens completely to the plains below, and Kilimanjaro in the distance.&#xA0; Your luxury tent overlooks a waterhole, and has one large bedroom with a private en suite bathroom, an indoor and outdoor shower and private "star-bed" / sundowner viewing deck.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Ol Donyo Lodge &#x2013; Private Vehicle&#xA0;- Asali Suite (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 14:&#xA0; Chyulu Hills (Amboseli)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Enjoy the camp activities. &#xA0;Over 7,000 wild animals inhabit the area in and around the Ol Donyo Wuas environs.&#xA0; Not only are the "Big Five" here &#x2013; rhino, elephant, lion, leopard and buffalo &#x2013; but also cheetah, fringe-eared oryx, gerenuk and giraffe among many others that share this diverse landscape.&#xA0; Guests are able to track wildlife by vehicle, foot, or horseback.&#xA0; And night drives are featured for those interested in spotting the more elusive nocturnal species.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ol Donyo Lodge &#x2013; Private Vehicle &#x2013; Asali Suite (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 15:&#xA0; Chyulu Hills&#xA0;/ Nairobi / Depart&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Following a restful morning on safari, return to the Ol Donyo private airstrip for your flight aboard a private Cessna 402 back to Nairobi&#x2019;s Wilson Airport; you are met and transferred to your famous hotel where a dayroom has been reserved for you to relax.&#xA0; This evening, a special dinner has been planned for you at the hotel restaurant where the Chef&#x2019;s Table has been reserved for you.&#xA0; Following dinner you are transferred to Kenyatta International Airport for your late night flight home.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Norfolk Hotel &#x2013; Signature Suite &#x2013; Dayroom (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

    <tour_highlights>&#x201C;This is an extremely in-depth program covering the best Egypt has to offer on the Nile between Lake Nasser and Alexandria.&#xA0; When people go on a typical Egypt trip, they see the highlights of Cairo and travel the Nile between Luxor and Aswan.&#xA0; Here, I have added a dimension that most others do not &#x2013; a Lake Nasser cruise to explore its Nubian temples and the Temple of Dendera north of Luxor.&#xA0; My clients look to me for new ideas and experiences that reach beyond the ordinary.&#xA0; I believe that this itinerary does just that, and shows Egypt at its finest.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Gisela Polo, Senior&#xA0;Destination Specialist&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 12:&#xA0; Alexandria&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Few cities in the world lean so heavily upon legend as Alexandria.&#xA0; It was founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BC, and was where his embalmed body was laid to rest eight years later after his conquest of Asia.&#xA0; It subsequently became the capital of Egypt under the Ptolemaic dynasty until the last of the line, Cleopatra, ended her life, and the city was conquered by the Romans.&#xA0; Today, Alexandria is Egypt&#x2019;s second largest city.&#xA0; Spend a fascinating day exploring remnants of the city's glorious past, including the National Museum and Pompey's Pillar, towering 93 feet over the site of the ancient Serapeum, the 2nd century Roman Amphitheater with its elegant marble terraces, and Al Montazah Palace, residence of the former royal family.&#xA0; Also step into the eerie tomb chambers of the 2000-year-old Kom el-Shugafa Catacombs, the last major construction in the Ptolemaic tradition.&#xA0; You can see the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, which was inaugurated in 2002 near the site of the ancient Library of Alexandria, which burned down in about 48 BC, probably by Julius Caesar.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Hotel Alexandria at San Stefano &#x2013; Sea View Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 13:&#xA0; Alexandria&#xA0;/ Cairo&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Return to Cairo to explore the finest sites of Islamic Cairo.&#xA0; You will begin at the mosque and madrasa of Sultan Hassan, where students used to live and study.&#xA0; Here you will see open-air classrooms around the imposing yet beautiful courtyard as well as the mosque&#x2019;s large stone minbar.&#xA0; Drive to the mosque of Ibn Tulun with its unusual minaret.&#xA0; This is the oldest mosque in Cairo.&#xA0; Legend claims that this was the site where Noah&#x2019;s Ark landed.&#xA0; Here you will also find the Gayer Anderson Museum, which houses the private collection of Major Gayer-Anderson as well as furniture, glassware, crystal, carpets, silks and embroidered Arab costumes.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza &#x2013; Nile View Room (B&lt;/strong&gt;)&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 14:&#xA0; Cairo&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;A spectacular, full day exploration of Cairo begins at the world-acclaimed Museum of Antiquities.&#xA0; The 300-year reign of the pharaohs is vividly brought to life in the wealth of art and artifacts here, including the Tutankhamen Collection of golden tomb artifacts; and exhibits of small, lifelike statuary from the early dynasties.&#xA0; You will visit the fascinating Mummy Room.&#xA0; Delve further into old Coptic Cairo with visits to the Church of St. Sergius and Ben Ezra Synagogue, built on a site where legend holds the baby Moses was found in the bulrushes.&#xA0; Take in the hilltop Citadel with its grand city views and ethereal Mohammed Ali Mosque.&#xA0; Then stroll with your guide through the Khan El Khalili, a vibrant warren of shops where you can bargain for rugs, copper and leather crafts, perfumes, and other goods both exotic and familiar.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza &#x2013; Nile View Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&#x201C;Both Jordan and Oman offer fantastic trekking opportunities with viewpoints and cultural experiences you simply cannot experience on a standard tour.&#xA0; In Jordan, you come upon Petra from the northern valley during a three-to four-hour walk, where you have bird&#x2019;s eye views of the seldom-visited Monastery (Ad-Deir).&#xA0; In Oman, you hike through traditional Arab villages set in the dramatic scenery of both the Wadi Shab and Jebel Akhdar.&#xA0; You encounter welcoming people and savor world-class accommodations.&#xA0; And, you will go home with prize pictures and memories of vistas seldom seen by even the most savvy traveler.&#x201D;&#xA0; Ashish Sanghrajka, President&#xD;

&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Amman, Jordan&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan! &#xA0;Upon arrival at the Queen Alia International Airport you will be met and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; The remainder of the day is at your leisure.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Hotel Amman &#x2013; Deluxe Room&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Amman &#x2013; Jerash / Ajlun (Roe Deer Trail)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning you will leave the hotel and then transfer to visit Jerash, the Roman city of Gerasa.&#xA0; Jerash displays some of the finest, most extensive and well-preserved remains of the former empire to be found anywhere.&#xA0; The colonnaded streets, temples, theatres, bathhouses and magnificent oval plaza are complemented by the superbly restored hippodrome, which in Roman times seated up to fifteen thousand people.&#xA0; Your next stop is Ajlun Castle, known today as Qalat ar-Rabad, which dominates the landscape from many kilometers away.&#xA0; It is one of the best-preserved medieval fortified structures in Jordan, and from its height above sea level of 1,250 meters, it furnishes spectacular views over the valley of the Jordan Rriver, all the way into Israel.&#xA0; Built by the Arabs of the Ayyubid Dynasty around 1185 AD and conquered and destroyed by the Mongols in 1260, the fortress was immediately rebuilt and enlarged by Mamluke Sultan Baibars.&#xA0; The castle was once surrounded by a broad moat with a drawbridge, now replaced with a boardwalk.&#xA0; After a series of U-bend entrances and various gateways set into the towers, a steep ramp leads to the upper redoubt, the best viewing area.&#xA0; Some of the most interesting rooms include casemates and arrow slits with rooms covered with cross or barrel vaulting.&#xA0; After touring the castle you will continue to the Roe Deer short circular trail in the Ajlun Nature Reserve.&#xA0; The total hike is less than one hour.&#xA0; The trail starts at the campsite and offers nice views over the Reserve.&#xA0; Not far from the campsite you will find an old stone wine press.&#xA0; Before you return to the visitor center you may be lucky enough to see the roe deer early in the morning. &#xA0;(&lt;em&gt;Please note that this trail is open from the 1st April until the 31st of October&lt;/em&gt;).&#xA0; After your hike you will then transfer to your hotel in Amman where the remainder of the day is at your leisure.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Hotel Amman &#x2013; Deluxe Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Amman / Madaba / Mount Nebo / Petra&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning you will leave the hotel and begin your tour of the modern and ancient capital of Jordan, known in history as Rabat and in Greco-Roman times as Philadelphia.&#xA0; No more than four hours drive from anywhere in the country, Amman is a convenient base for any tour within the Kingdom.&#xA0; Your hosts, the Jordanians, are wonderfully gracious and welcoming and most will surprise you with their excellent English. &#xA0;The city is crowned by the Citadel, a hill with the ruins of the Temple of Hercules, and a museum with artifacts dating back to the earliest settlement in the region some 700,000 years ago.&#xA0; At the foot of the Citadel lies the 5,000 seats Roman Theater.&#xA0; Then you will drive to south of Amman along the 5,000 years old King&#x2019;s Highway (one of the most memorable journeys in the Holy Land), passing through a string of ancient sites. &#xA0;The first city along the way from the north is Madaba, "the City of Mosaics" which has been intermittently inhabited for nearly 3,500 years.&#xA0; The chief attraction in this city is a wonderfully vivid, six-century Byzantine mosaic map showing Jerusalem and other holy sites. &#xA0;There are also literally hundreds of other mosaics scattered throughout Madaba's churches and homes.&#xA0; Ten minutes to the west is Mount Nebo, the memorial of Moses, and the presumed site of the prophet's death and burial place.&#xA0; From a platform in front of the church one can enjoy a breathtaking view across the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea.&#xA0; Continue to Petra where you will check into your hotel for the night.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Movenpick Resort Petra &#x2013; Junior Suite (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Petra&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast you will leave the hotel and drive to Little Petra, where you will set out on a walk&#xA0; (between 3-4 hours) through Beidha Road where you will join your local guide.&#xA0; Then you will arrive at the Monastery (Ad-Deir).&#xA0; Although it may have been later used as a church, it was probably originally a temple. It may have been dedicated to the deified Nabatean king, Obodas I, who reigned in the 1st century BC.&#xA0; The Monastery is similar to design to the Treasury, but it is much larger (50 meters high x 45 meters wide) and much less decorated. &#xA0;The facade is flat on the lower level and deeply carved on the upper level, with engaged columns and two half-pediments flanking a central urn (10 meters high).&#xA0; The Monastery is an hour's climb northwest of the city center on an ancient rock-cut path of about 800 steps.&#xA0; The path begins behind the Basin Restaurant and Nabatean Museum.&#xA0; It may sound daunting, but there are plenty of places to rest, and donkeys available to rent.&#xA0; Two-thirds up is a peaceful spring, and there are various other minor points of interest along the way, such as the Lion Triclinium.&#xA0; The best time to climb to the monastery is in the afternoon, when the path is mostly in shade and the sun is shining on the Monastery's fa&#xE7;ade.&#xA0; You will then drive to the red city of Petra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&#xA0; Petra is the legacy of the Nabateans, an industrious Arab people who settled in south Jordan more than 2,000 years ago.&#xA0; Much of Petra's appeal comes from its spectacular setting deep inside a narrow desert gorge.&#xA0; From the main entrance, you proceed on foot through the awesome "Siq", an immense crack in the sandstone that winds for one kilometer between overhanging cliffs.&#xA0; Petra's most famous monument, the Treasury&#xA0;(Al-Khazneh), appears dramatically at the end of the Siq and various walks and climbs reveal literally hundreds of buildings, facades, tombs, baths, funerary halls, temples and a 3,000 seat theater from the 1st Century AD.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Movenpick Resort Petra &#x2013; Junior Suite (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Petra / Wadi Rum / Feynan&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, leave the hotel and then transfer to Wadi Rum. &#xA0;The uniquely shaped massive mountains rise vertically out of the pink desert sand, which separate one dark mass from another in magnificent desert scenery of strange breathtaking beauty, with towering cliffs of weathered stone.&#xA0; The faces of the sheer rock cliffs have been eroded by the wind into faces of men, animals and monsters.&#xA0; Wadi Rum is probably best known because of its connection with the enigmatic British officer T.E. Lawrence, who was based here during the Great Arab Revolt of 1917-18, and as the setting for the film that carried his name "Lawrence of Arabia".&#xA0; Everywhere in this moonscape place are indications of man's presence since the earliest known times.&#xA0; The valley floors are some 900-1000 meters above sea level, and the great sandstone crags rise sheer, a further 500-550 meters.&#xA0; Jabal Rum is the highest peak in the area and the 2nd highest in Jordan.&#xA0; Others are some 27 kilometers north of the Rum village like Jabal Kharaz and Jabal Burdah with its Rock Bridge which is one of Wadi Rum's most popular attractions.&#xA0; After the tour you will transfer to Feynan Ecolodge for dinner and overnight.&#xA0; Deep in the heart of the mountainous Dana Biosphere Reserve, at the end of a rugged track, an idyllic candle-lit lodge rests in the magnificent Wadi Feynan.&#xA0; Here, set against the glorious desert landscape, guests staying at the 26-room lodge can be found adventuring through the untouched outdoors, sipping mint tea with the native Bedouin, exploring local archaeological sites or simply unwinding in the serene courtyards and terraces of the candle-lit complex; safe in the knowledge that they are vacationing in a socially and environmentally-responsible way.&#xA0; Hailed as one of the top fifty eco-lodges in the world by National Geographic Adventure magazine, the solar powered Feynan Ecolodge offers the most developed eco-experience in Jordan.&#xA0; This is an experience made possible by a unique partnership between EcoHotels and the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature, a Jordanian NGO devoted to the protection of the Kingdom&#x2019;s finest natural landscapes.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Feynan Ecolodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Feynan &#x2013; Dana Nature Reserve&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today, you will embark on a day-long, 14 kilometer guided journey that will satisfy all your senses.&#xA0; Start from the Feynan Ecolodge at 325 meters above sea level and adventure up through the beautiful Dana Biosphere Reserve to the Dana Guesthouse at 1,200 meters.&#xA0; Cross paths and exchange warm greetings with local Bedouin tending their goats or stop to rest and enjoy sweet tea.&#xA0; Experience the different bio-geological zones of Dana and keep an eye out for the many rare forms of flora and fauna to be found here such as the Nubian ibex.&#xA0; Upon arrival at the Dana Guesthouse, you will be transferred back to Feynan Ecolodge where you will have dinner.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Feynan Ecolodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Feynan / Sanctuary of Lot / Karak / Mukawir / Ma&#x2019;in&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, you will leave the hotel and then transfer to Sanctuary of Lot.&#xA0; The recent archaeological excavations in Ghor es-Safi have identified the Sanctuary of Agios Lot depicted on the Madaba map as the site of Deir 'Ain 'Abata.&#xA0; On the basis of this discovery a reassessment of the topography of the southeastern Dead Sea shore is necessary. &#xA0;Additional new surveys and surface collections have confirmed the location of the city of Zoara and suggest a more probable course for the Zared River. &#xA0;The site of Deir 'Ain 'Abata was first recorded in 1986 during the Southern Ghors and Northern 'Arabah Survey as site no. 46 (MacDonald 1992: 253-254).&#xA0; The evidence from the surface was strong enough to suggest that a Byzantine monastic complex once existed there (MacDonald and Politis 1988: 292-291).&#xA0; The clear importance of the site spurred an excavation project that began in 1988 and continued until 1996.&#xA0; Then, you will transfer to Karak, now the site of a flourishing town that is known for the imposing fort.&#xA0; It was erected in the first half of the 12th century by the Crusaders, who were eventually conquered by the Arabs. &#xA0;This spectacular fortress is located at an altitude of 1,000 meters in a dominating position where the ancient capital of the Moabite kingdom (cited in the Bible) had once stood.&#xA0; Continue north to Mukawir.&#xA0; This dramatic hilltop is the traditional site of the execution of John the Baptist. &#xA0;It lies less than 20 kilometers southwest of Madaba at the King's Highway on a stark promontory (720 meters), overlooking the Dead Sea and protected on three sides by deep ravines.&#xA0; After your tour of Mukawir, you will transfer to Ma&#x2019;in where you will check into your deluxe accommodations upon arrival.&#xA0; Lying 264-meters below sea level, Ma&#x2019;In Hot Springs is the inspired site for the well appointed Evason Ma&#x2019;In Hot Springs.&#xA0; Set like an oasis in the dramatic terrain, the location is easily accessible and defines the resort and spa experience in the Middle East - making it a destination of choice for those seeking the perfect retreat to relax and be pampered whilst enjoying the therapeutic benefits of Ma&#x2019;In hot spring waterfalls.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Evason&#xA0;Ma&#x2019;in Hot Springs &#x2013; Evason Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8: &#xA0;Ma&#x2019;in / Wadi&#xA0;Mujib / Amman&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning you will leave the hotel and then transfer to Malaqi trail in Wadi Mujib. &#xA0;You will enjoy a guided hike that is about 6 to 8 hours.&#xA0; This trail is open from April 1st to October 31st. &#xA0;This is an exciting water trail.&#xA0; It starts at the visitor center and follows the same route into the nature reserve as other trails. &#xA0;It leads quickly to a striking area of creamy-white hills made of soft rock deposits.&#xA0; After passing through these hills, you begin your descent to the river Mujib, which is crystal clear, fast flowing and teeming with life.&#xA0; Small fish are plentiful, as well as frogs. &#xA0;Bright kingfishers are often seen speeding along the river channel, as well as circling birds of prey. &#xA0;Dense vegetation lines the riversides, making a stark contrast to the arid, naked mountains that surround you.&#xA0; The hike continues upstream along in the river to its confluence with the Hidan River (Malagi area). &#xA0;Here you can linger, eat a picnic and just enjoy this wild paradise.&#xA0; You can also enjoy swimming in the natural pools.&#xA0; You then move on through the Mujib gorge to descend a waterfall, 20 meters in height, using ropes.&#xA0; From here you continue along the rest of the river, and return back to the visitor center.&#xA0; After the end of the tour you will transfer to Amman for the evening.&#xA0; &lt;em&gt;*Please note that the Malaqi Traill is only operational on certain times of the year, so you can always substitute it with another trail accordingly.&lt;/em&gt;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Hotel Amman &#x2013; Deluxe Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; Amman / Muscat, Oman&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you will transfer to Queen Alia International Airport where you will board your flight to Muscat in the Sultanate of Oman.&#xA0; Upon arrival in Oman, a Plaza Lounge representative will be waiting for you before the Immigration area and will take you the Lounge, where you enjoy Omani hospitality. &#xA0;Hot or cold refreshments are served and the lounge executive completes the Immigration formalities. &#xA0;(&lt;em&gt;If you have any problems in finding the Lounge representative, please head to the Lounge located in the entrance area of the terminal and the Lounge staff will help you with the Visa&lt;/em&gt;)&#xA0; After collecting your baggage, you will be met by your Big Five representative and privately transferred to your accommodation, which is a drive of approximately 20 minutes.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;The&#xA0;Chedi Muscat &#x2013; Chedi Club Suite (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10:&#xA0; Muscat&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After a leisurely breakfast, enjoy a private tour of Muscat, which lies in a natural volcanic bowl.&#xA0; First, take in the Grand Mosque (&lt;em&gt;open for tourist from 9-11:00 AM except Thursdays and Fridays&lt;/em&gt;), the most exquisite Mosque in Oman.&#xA0; The developed part of the site, including the fully consolidate&#xD;
areas and landscaping, covers 416,000 square meters.&#xA0; The Mosque complex (covering 40,000 square meters) is constructed on a raised podium in keeping with the tradition of Omani mosques that were built elevated from street level.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;Dress code &#x2013; Women should wear attire covering fully their arms and legs with their heads covered by a scarf.&#xA0; Men should wear normal clothes.&lt;/em&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Bangalore&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Bangalore is one of Asia's fastest growing cities and is the principal administrative, cultural, commercial and industrial center of the state of Karnataka.&#xA0; It is often described as Asia&#x2019;s Silicon Valley because of its thriving information technology industry.&#xA0; Until its high-tech boom in the late 1980s, this was known as the Garden City with its pleasant temperate climate.&#xA0; Today with a growing population of young professionals, it has acquired a vibrant, cosmopolitan air.&#xA0; In spite of rapid development, vestiges of the city&#x2019;s historic past are still found in Old Bangalore, with its monuments from the 16th to the 19th centuries.&#xA0; On this morning&#x2019;s brief tour, visit Tipu&#x2019;s Palace within the original citadel, a mud-brick fort built in 1537.&#xA0; Tipu Sultan's Palace, dating from about 1790, is made mostly of wood with finely embellished balconies, pillars and arches.&#xA0; This two-story structure is a replica of the Daria Daulat Bagh in Srirangapattana that served as a summer retreat for Tipu sultan.&#xA0; While the palace retains its original elegant teak pillars, most of the painted decorations have been destroyed.&#xA0; This afternoon is at leisure.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Shreyas Retreat - Cottage (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: &#xA0;Bangalore /&#xA0;Chikmagalur&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;(6 hour drive)&#xD;
This morning, you drive to Chikmagalur, with a stop on the way stop at Sravanabelagola, an important Jain pilgrimage center.&#xA0; The colossal statue of Gomateshwara (nearly 56-feet/17 meters high) is situated on the summit of Indragiri.&#xA0; The giant statue was commissioned during the 10th century and is carved from a single block of stone.&#xA0; Some regard it as one of the largest monolithic statues in the world.&#xA0; Continue your drive and on arrival check into your hotel, a luxury oasis and destination resort on a coffee estate near Chikmagalur.&#xA0; The remainder of your day is at leisure to pursue your own interests. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;The Serai Resort &#x2013; Estate Villa (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: &#xA0;Chikmagalur&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Chikmagalur is a serene town nestled in the Baba Budan Hills with valleys, streams and coffee plantations.&#xA0; Coffee was planted here for the first time in India in the mid-17th century.&#xA0; The area of&#xA0;Chikmagalur is a trekker's delight with the rugged mountain trails and rare wildlife sanctuary in addition to ancient temples and forts.&#xA0; Take a stroll through the coffee plantations or catch a magnificent sunset.&#xA0; Experience the best of Western Ghats in Chikmagalur.&#xA0; After breakfast, visit the famous temples of Halebid and Belur, built in the early 12th century.&#xA0; In the 16th century, the temples were at the heart of the throbbing Hoysala Empire.&#xA0; The Hoysala were huge patrons of art and architecture and built massive temples that have survived the ravages of time. &#xA0;Some of the sculptures are so exotic, erotic and eloquent - that you half expect them to speak or move.&#xA0; Halebid was the capital of the Hoysalas until it was destroyed in the early 14th century by the Delhi Sultanate.&#xA0; The Hoysaleshwara temple survived the pillage but it remained incomplete even after 87 years of uninterrupted construction. &#xA0;The temple is dedicated to Shiva and has two enormous Nandi bulls at the entrance.&#xA0; About 16 km away is Belur with the outstanding Chenakeshava temple, a monumental edifice that took 103 years to build, possibly because of the intricate details and the myriad of friezes and sculptures that embellish the walls.&#xA0; Scenes from the epics, elephants in battle and sensuous dancers come alive in stone.&#xA0; The 42 'madanikas' or celestial dancers were inspired by Queen Shantaladevi, who is said to have epitomized beauty. &#xA0;The Hoysala architects had an eye for detail and such wizardry with their chisels that the earrings on the lobes of the dancers can rotate and beads of perspiration glisten in the hair of some.&#xA0; Return to your hotel and overnight in Chikmagalur.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Serai Resort &#x2013; Estate Villa (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

After breakfast drive through the lovely South Indian countryside to Nagarhole National Park.&#xA0; On arrival in Nagarhole, you will check into the resort of Orange County.&#xA0; Its &#x2018;Spirit of the Land&#x2019; philosophy finds its most intimate expression at Kabini.&#xA0; While you are cradled in the lap of luxury, the resort gives you a wildlife experience like no other.&#xA0; Steeped in local lore and culture, and inspired in design by the tribal villages, this resort is bordered on two sides by the Kabini River.&#xA0; This afternoon will be at your leisure to relax and explore your surroundings; or enjoy the spa facilities at the resort.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Orange County Resort &#x2013; Jacuzzi Hut (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;This 400-year-old city of minarets and Mughlai food has recently staked another claim to fame &#x2014; as India&#x2019;s newest tech city.&#xA0; Some of the biggest Fortune 500 companies, including giants like Microsoft, IBM, Oracle and Google, have set up shop here in the last decade or so, thus earning it the sobriquet of Cyberabad.&#xA0; In the 1500s when it was founded on the banks of the Musi River, it became a wealthy city trading in pearls and diamonds.&#xA0; Legend has it that the shah fell in love with and married a local Banjara (gypsy) girl, who changed her name to Hyder Mahal upon her conversion to Islam, thereupon bestowing her name to the city.&#xA0; Divided by the picturesque Hussain Sagar tank into the twin towns of Secunderabad and Hyderabad, this ancient city has a charming landscape dotted by tanks and hills.&#xA0; The original town on the river bank, now known as &#x2018;old city&#x2019; has the famous Charminar and Mecca Masjid, and its narrow bustling streets contrast sharply with the new Hyderabad. &#xA0;The old city is where the locals go for the best Hyderabadi cuisine, which is a rich blend of Mughal, Persian and Telugu influences.&#xA0; Walk into the teeming old markets close to Charminar with shops selling bangles, pearls and jewelry.&#xA0; In fact, Hyderabad still presides over a thriving trade in cultured pearls.&#xA0; This morning after breakfast, tour the Golconda Fort and Qutab Shahi Tombs.&#xA0; Sprawling across a boulder-strewn plateau, Golconda Fort was the citadel of the Qutb Shahi dynasty that ruled Hyderabad from 1507 to 1687.&#xA0; The earlier mud fort was transformed into a splendid fortified city of grand palaces, mosques and gardens.&#xA0; The fort was also famous for its great hoard of diamonds, mined nearby, which included the celebrated Kohinoor Diamond.&#xA0; Qutb Shahi Tombs - this royal necropolis where seven of the nine Qutb Shahi rulers are buried is laid out in gardens with water channels, pools and tree-lined pathways.&#xA0; The tombs, built by each king in his lifetime, display a distinct and eclectic architectural style.&#xA0; Enjoy this afternoon to pursue your own interests.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Taj Falaknuma Palace &#x2013; Palace Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;Charminar (Four Towers) in the heart of the Old City is Hyderabad&#x2019;s signature landmark.&#xA0; Built in 1591, it is the hub of a busy commercial area, where the grand mosques and palaces of the rulers are today surrounded by lively bazaars selling everything from pearls and perfumes to vegetables and computers.&#xA0; Drive to the Salar Jung Museum with its fascinating collection of art. &#xA0;This eclectic collection of over 40,000 objects once belonged to Salarjung III, Prime Minister of Hyderabad between 1899 and 1949.&#xA0; The pride of the museum is the outstanding Mughal Jade collection and inlaid ivory objects.&#xA0; The remainder of the day is at leisure. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Taj Falaknuma Palace &#x2013; Palace Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Ecuador.&#xA0; After claiming your luggage, you will be met by your Big Five Ecuador representative and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Mansion del Angel Hotel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Quito&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
The capital of Ecuador, Quito, lies at an elevation of 9,000 feet in the province of Pichincha surrounded by the Andes Mountains.&#xA0; One of the most beautiful capitals in the world, the city was founded as San Francisco de Quito on December 6th, 1534 by the Spanish conquistador and sanctioned through the auspices of UNESCO in 1978 to be a World Cultural Heritage Site.&#xA0; The historic center of Quito, known as the "Old City" is replete with narrow and winding cobblestone streets, magnificent churches and wide-open squares.&#xA0; The buildings that line the streets reflect Spanish colonial influence with their balconies, tile roofs, thick columns and central patios. &#xA0;A full-day private tour of Quito begins in the colonial quarter, with its incomparably rich La Compania Church, San Francisco Square, and other landmarks.&#xA0; Drive up Panecillo Hill for glorious views of the city and surrounding mountains.&#xA0; You visit the Astronomical Observatory, the oldest astronomical observatory in South America, built in 1873.&#xA0; It houses the unique Merz Equatorial Telescope, designed to scan both Northern and Southern constellations, given that Quito is just 25 miles south of latitude zero.&#xA0; You see a number of antique instruments used in the 19th century for map making, weather recording, terrestrial and celestial observation.&#xA0; Even more important, it was essential in developing the metric system of measurement!&#xA0; It even houses the first meter that was constructed out of an alloy of iridium and platinum.&#xA0; Then, in the heart of colonial Quito, on what is believed to be the oldest pre-Hispanic street in the city, there is the most delightful piano repair shop operated by the son of one of Ecuador&#xB4;s most famous musicians and composers, Humberto Santacruz.&#xA0; By special arrangement, you enter a small patio courtyard where the shop displays an old 1902 player piano built in New York City and, later painstakingly rebuilt by &#x201C;the piano plastic surgeon&#x201D; as he is known in the neighborhood.&#xA0; Sr. Santacruz will play a couple of local compositions reminiscent of the country&#xB4;s traditional beat.&#xA0; Enjoy a typical lunch overlooking the serene countryside and stand in the northern and southern hemispheres simultaneously at the Equatorial Monument before returning to your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Mansion del Angel Hotel (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;Full day visit to Cajas National Park with lunch at typical restaurant at the reserve.&#xA0; Cajas provides about 60% of the drinking water for the Cuenca area.&#xA0; Two of the four rivers of Cuenca originate from Cajas, and eventually drain into the great Amazon River.&#xA0; See strikingly jagged peaks and lagoons.&#xA0; In the lower regions of the park, the cloud forest and perennial high mountain forest are present, mostly near the brooks and rivers.&#xA0; Enjoy a nature walk in these dramatic landscapes before returning in the afternoon to Cuenca.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Mansion Alcanzar (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>Morocco: Splendors of the Berber South</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>"Not many journeys that offer Morocco focus on areas outside of the famous Imperial Cities, the Sahara, or, maybe, the Rif Mountains.&#xA0; What many of even the savviest of travelers do not realize is that there is a wealth of diverse Berber culture in the towns and villages of Morocco's far south.&#xA0; These ancient and distinctive societies have survived for thousands of years, and yet they are often overlooked.&#xA0; And I think that&#x2019;s a great loss for the traveler who yearns for authentic connections.&#xA0; And now, there are some unique, wonderful properties in Taroudannt and Souss-Massa National Park that make this a fantastic adventure &#x2013; both luxurious and off-the-beaten path."&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Ashish Sanghrajka, President&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Travel far off the beaten track to explore the Berber culture in depth in the villages and towns of the High Atlas Mountains and the Ante Atlas Mountains&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Discover some of Morrocco&#x2019;s oldest cities such as Casablanca, Marrakech,&#xA0; Essaouira and Taroudannt, known as the Grandmother of Marrakech&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Learn firsthand about ancient methods still in use day as they have been for millennia such as the Berber women who produce the prized argan oil from the argan tree, known here as the Tree of Life&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Visit the remote Souss-Massa National Park, primarily a bird sanctuary, home to pink flamingos, three of the four Moroccan colonies of the rare and endangered Northern bald Ibis, glossy ibis, marbled duck as well as oryx, addax, jackal, Algerian hedgehog, African wild cat, gazelle, ostrich, leopard lizard, weasel, red fox and a variety of reptiles and rare amphibians&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div&gt;Enjoy stays at traditional raids and distinctive small hotels&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Morocco! &#xA0;Upon arrival at Casablanca&#x2019;s Mohammed V International Airport you will be met by your private, licensed, national guide and driver, and taken to visit the amazingly beautiful Hassan II Mosque, which is the second largest mosque in the Islamic world after the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca.&#xA0; From here, travel south on a three-hour drive to the Berber imperial city of Marrakech and your charming riad.&#xA0; After checking in, you will set out on a brief familiarization excursion of this cosmopolitan city in a horse-drawn carriage to see the famous ramparts and monuments of this garden city, including the delightful Majorelle Gardens and Museum belonging to the late fashion icon Yves Saint Laurent.&#xA0;&#xA0;On to the Medina via the dramatic Almohad Koutoubia Mosque (&lt;em&gt;entrance is prohibited to non-Muslims&lt;/em&gt;), one of the major architectural triumphs of the Berber Almohad Dynasty.&#xA0; Returning to your riad, you dine at the restaurant, outside in the courtyard or on the roof terrace overlooking the ancient city with the High Atlas Mountains as a backdrop.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Riad El Fenn &#x2013; Colonnade Room (D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Marrakech&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After a leisurely breakfast, you venture into the Kasbah and Mellah (once the Jewish Quarter) to the lavishly-decorated Saadien Tombs.&#xA0; This is the ancient cemetery of the shorfa, the descendants of the Prophet Mohammed. &#xA0;Proceed to the late 19th-century Dar el Bahia Palace built for the black slave Si' Ahmed Ben Musa and the Dar Si Said Museum, which houses both traditional and contemporary exhibitions of Moroccan arts and sculpture.&#xA0; You will also explore the Bert Flint Museum, which displays the massive collection of art, weapons, and furniture of the famous Dutch anthropologist. &#xA0;Then visit the 14th-century Ben Youssef Medersa, one of the most beautiful buildings in Marrakech that housed the Islamic equivalent of a monastery, and the Almoravid Dynasty Koubba (the oldest building in Marrakech). &#xA0;Your next stop is the Marrakech Museum of Art and then the labyrinth of narrow covered alleyways of the famous souqs, finishing your journey with a lunch overlooking Djmaa el Fnaa Square.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Riad El Fenn &#x2013; Colonnade Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;Today you drive south across the Haouz Plain with its olive-groves and citrus-tree orchards.&#xA0; As you start to ascend into the High Atlas valleys, you pass through the Berber town of Tahanaoute before winding your way up past the Moulay Brahim Gorges and into the high valleys.&#xA0; Pass under the little town of Zaouiat Moulay Brahim perched on a cliff overlooking a oued, a seasonal river.&#xA0; You pass small, scratch-farmed irrigated plots clawed from the mountain sides, some of which are centuries old.&#xA0; Disocver Berber hamlets of Imi Ourghlad, Tinifine, Aguerssioual and Taddart carved out of the mountainside.&#xA0;&#xA0;At the village of Imlil, stop for a refreshing glass of mint tea.&#xA0; Then set out on a trek, either on foot or on a mule, up to the Berber village of Aroumd.&#xA0; Another five miles brings you to hamlet of Sidi Chamharouch beside a small waterfall and stream.&#xA0; This village is a place of pilgrimage to devout Muslims who come to the Marabout&#x2019;s shrine (&lt;em&gt;forbidden to non-Muslims&lt;/em&gt;). &#xA0;It is said to be a pre-Islamic relic.&#xA0; You can take a break for a picnic lunch within full view of Jbel Toubkal, at 13,672 feet the highest peak in the Maghreb. &#xA0;Then, you travel down the other side of the valley back to Imlil and return trip to Marrakech.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Riad El Fenn &#x2013; Colonnade Room (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Marrakech / Tizi N&#x2019;Test Pass / Taroudannt&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; (6 hour drive)&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;The road you take today is one of the most spectacular drives in Morocco.&#xA0; Passing through the Berber market town of Asni, you drive through the green Ouirgane Valley with the red clay hills along the river N&#x2019;Fis.&#xA0; You will visit the roofless shell of the 12th-century mosque of Tin-Mal, which Marrakech&#x2019;s Koutoubia and many other mosques in Morocco are modeled after.&#xA0; Travel the Tizi N&#x2019;Test, a road that cuts through the mountains via a series of switchbacks over the pass to the tip of the Saharan side of the mountains as it descends into the Souss Valley.&#xA0; It is still only one car and a half wide in places, with 1,500 feet cliffs common.&#xA0; With no barriers, the road is traveled only during daylight hours.&#xA0; Once through the pass, you descend to the Chleuh Berber town of Taroudannt and your hotel.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;La Gazelle D&#x2019;Or &#x2013; Bougainvillea Pavilion (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Taroudannt&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Long before Marrakech was built, Taroudannt was known as the Grandmother of Marrakech.&#xA0; Explore one of Morocco&#x2019;s oldest towns, beginning with the magnificent ramparts, which lead you to the Place Assaraq and the nearby bustling souqs.&#xA0; Then, you will go to see Berber women producing prized argan oil., which is the time-honoured way for Berber women to make money.&#xA0; The nutritional oil has been used for thousands of years in couscous, salads and dipping bread as an alternative to olive oil.&#xA0; And, it is popular today throughout Europe and parts of the U.S., used for massage, hair and nail care.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;La Gazelle D&#x2019;Or &#x2013; Bougainvillea Pavilion (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0;&#xA0;Siem Reap, Cambodia&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Cambodia!&#xA0; Upon arrival you will be met and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Anantara Angkor Resort &amp;amp; Spa&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Siem Reap&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today you begin your exploration of one of the most outstanding archaeological sights in all of Asia &#x2013; the crown jewel of Khmer architecture, Angkor Wat.&#xA0; The largest, best preserved, and most religiously significant temple complex, Angkor impresses visitors both by its sheer scale and beautifully proportioned layout, as well as the delicate artistry of its carvings.&#xA0; To approach the temple, first cross the vast moat, continuing along a broad causeway lined with wonderful naga balustrades.&#xA0; As you enter the main building, ascend through a series of galleries and courtyards before reaching the central sanctuary, which offers beautiful views back over the causeway and across the surrounding countryside.&#xA0; On the way, pause to enjoy the intricate stone carvings that adorn nearly every surface, with some 1,700 Apsaras, or celestial dancers, sculpted into the walls.&#xA0; Along the outer gallery walls run the longest continuous bas-relief in the world, which narrates stories from Hindu mythology, including the famous Churning of the Ocean of Milk.&#xA0; Angkor Wat is stunning at any time of the day, but sunrise and sunset are especially beautiful times to watch the play of light on the stones.&#xA0; Seemingly miniature in comparison to the other Angkor temples, Banteay Srei is considered to be the jewel of classical Khmer art.&#xA0; Built in pink sandstone, the walls are covered in exquisitely preserved carvings of unusual delicacy.&#xA0; Because of its small size, fairy-like atmosphere and extraordinary examples of Khmer sculpture, this temple is often a favorite with visitors.&#xA0; Watch the sunset over the Cambodian countryside from the upper terraces of an ancient Angkorian temple.&#xA0; The fortified city of Angkor Thom covers an area of 10 square kilometers.&#xA0; Enclosed by a wall and wide moats, the city includes many of Angkor's most popular sights.&#xA0; Enter by the monumental South Gate over a causeway lined on either side by statues of demons and gods, each carrying a giant naga.&#xA0; Continue to the Terrace of the Elephants and the Terrace of the Leper Kings, former spaces for public ceremonies, both adorned with dramatic bas reliefs.&#xA0; Visit the ruined Baphuon, Royal Enclosure and Phimeanakas before continuing to the mysterious Bayon Temple.&#xA0; In this temple, one of the most popular and compelling in Angkor, explore the galleries of beautifully preserved bas reliefs and ascend narrow stairs to reach the central sanctuary, where you will find giant stone faces smiling enigmatically down at you from every angle.&#xA0; Ta Prohm is one of the most popular sites at Angkor because it is still cloaked in the jungle, looking very much as all the Angkor monuments would have to the early explorers.&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Anantara Angkor Resort &amp;amp; Spa (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Siem Reap &#x2013; Koh Ker&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;From Siem Reap, travel northeast off the beaten track to Koh Ker, a remote group of early Angkorian ruins from the 10th century capital of Jayavarman IV.&#xA0; Much of it is in ruins and some temples are still engulfed by massive tree roots.&#xA0; But several monuments and temples still remain, with some of the most interesting being the pyramidal Prasat Thom, Prasat Bram and Prasat Leung.&#xA0; Less than one percent of the visitors to Siem Reap ever make it out to Koh Ker, giving you the increasingly rare opportunity to interact with this remarkable site on your own without crowds &#x2013; at least for now.&#xA0; Note: Big Five&#x2019;s nonprofit arm, the Spirit of Big Five Foundation (&lt;a href="http://www.spiritofbigfive.org/"&gt;www.spiritofbigfive.org&lt;/a&gt;), has an active project in Koh Ker, teaming with Heritage Watch to help preserve the irreplaceable heritage of Cambodia.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Anantara Angkor Resort &amp;amp; Spa (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: &#xA0;Siem Reap / Luang Prabang, Laos&#xD;

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0;Bangkok, Thailand / Yangon, Myanmar &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Welcome to Indochina.&#xA0; Arrive in Bangkok and connect your onward flight to Yangon, where you are met on arrival and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; The rest of the day is at leisure. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;The Governor&#x2019;s Residence - Governors Room&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0;Yangon&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Yangon lies in the fertile delta of southern Myanmar, on the wide Yangon River. &#xA0;The city is filled with tree-shaded boulevards, with shimmering stupas peaking out above the treetops.&#xA0; The city became the capital in 1885, when the British completed the conquest of Upper Myanmar.&#xA0; Mandalay's brief period as capital of the last Burmese kingdom ended.&#xA0; The city is filled with historic treasures.&#xA0; Botataung Pagoda was named after the 1,000 military leaders who were said to have escorted sacred relics of Buddha brought from India more than 2,000 years ago. &#xA0;This ancient monument was completely destroyed during WWII.&#xA0; It was then rebuilt in a very similar style to its predecessor. &#xA0;Ngadatkyi Paya in the Ashay Tawya monastery, and contains a seated Buddha image five stories high.&#xA0; The national museum offers several interesting exhibits, especially the eight-meter high Sihasana Lion Throne, used by King Thibaw Min, the last Burmese king. &#xA0;It was removed by the British but returned to Burma in 1908 by Lord Mountbatten. The main floor contains jewelry, historic black and white photos of Mandalay Palace and Yangon, royal relics, Hintha opium weights and inscribed tablets. Buddhist Art Museum, housed in a 1952 Art Deco-style building, has a dominant lotus window that depicts all the attitudes of Buddha.&#xA0;The museum's contents include begging bowls, palm leaf scriptures and 18th through 20th century wooden Buddha images. Maha Wizaya Pagoda, only built in the 1980, is noted for a ceiling depicting Burmese constellations and a permanent display of pagoda styles through the ages.&#xA0; Sule Pagoda, with its 48-meter-high golden dome, was used by the British as the nucleus of their grid pattern for the city when it was rebuilt in the 1880s. The pagoda's peculiarity is its octagonal-shaped stupa, which retains its shape as it tapers to the spire.&#xA0; Shwedagon Pagoda at sunset is a highlight of Yangon.&#xA0;This pagoda dates back some 2,500 years and was built to house eight sacred hairs of Buddha. &#xA0;Its original shape has changed beyond all recognition over the centuries.&#xA0;Its bell-shaped superstructure, resting on a terraced base, is covered in about 60 tons of gold-leaf, which is continuously being replaced. &lt;strong&gt;The Governor&#x2019;s Residence &#x2013; Governors Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Yangon / Bagan&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you fly to Bagan, where you are met and transferred to your hotel. Bagan is a spectacular plain stretching away from the Ayeyarwaddy River, dotted with thousands of 800-year-old temple ruins. &#xA0;Although human habitation at Bagan dates back almost to the beginning of the Christian era, Bagan only entered its golden period with the conquest of Thaton in 1057 AD. Shwezigon Pagoda was created to enshrine some relicts of Buddha.&#xA0;The construction was completed between 1086 and1090.&#xA0;Originally, it marked the northern end of the city of Bagan. The stupa's graceful bell shape became a prototype for virtually all later stupas around Myanmar. Gubyaukhyi Temple at Wetkyi-Inn was built in the early 13th century.&#xA0;The great colorful painting about the past life of Buddha and the distinguished architecture make this temple interesting. Ananda Pahto is one of the finest, largest, best preserved of Bagan&#x2019;s temples. Thought to have been built around 1105, this perfectly proportioned temple is one of the most sacred in this city of temples. It also heralds the stylistic end of the Early Bagan period and the beginning of the Middle period. Gubyaukgyi Temple at Myinkaba dates from 1113 and is known for its preserved stuccos on the exterior walls.&#xA0;The magnificent paintings date from the original construction of the temple and are considered to be the oldest original paintings in Bagan. Built in 1059, Manuha Temple enshrines the unusual combination of three seated and one reclining image Buddha. Shwesandaw Paya, 1057, is the first monument in Bagan to feature stairways leading up from the square bottom terraces to the round base of the Stupa. &#xA0;It is a lovely spot to catch the magnificent sunsets. &lt;strong&gt;Aureum Palace Resort Bagan &#x2013; Jasmine Villa Lake View (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: Bagan&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you are in for a real treat &#x2013; a hot air balloon ride over the plains of Bagan with its hundreds of temples. Upon landing, enjoy some refreshments. Mount Popa rises 737 meters, 2,418 feet approximately, from the flats surrounding Myingyan Plain. It is said to be an extinct volcano that hasn&#x2019;t been active for 250,000 years ago. It is considered the home of Myanmar's most powerful spirits, nats, and is as such is the most important nat worship center in the country.&#xA0;Among the myriad of&#xA0;sacred structures there are many of note.&#xA0;Mahabodhi Temple was built between 1211 and 1234 during the Late Bagan period, and this temple is the only surviving one of this style in Bagan. Dhamayangyi Temple dates from the 12th century. &#xA0;Sulamani Temple dates from 1181, and is one of the best examples of the later, more sophisticated temple styles. Carved stucco on moldings, pediments and pilasters represent some of Bagan&#x2019;s finest ornamental work. Nandamannya Temple is a small, single-chambered temple that dates from the 13th century, with mural paintings in the interior.&#xA0;Thatbyinnyu Temple, at about 61 meters/ 200 feet high, is one of Bagan&#x2019;s tallest monuments; and its large size makes it a classic example of Bagan&#x2019;s middle period. &lt;strong&gt;Aureum Palace Resort Bagan &#x2013; Jasmine Villa Lake View (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0;Bagan / Mandalay&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you are transferred by flight from Bagan to Mandalay, where you are met and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0;Mandalay was the last capital of Myanmar before the British took over so it still import as a cultural center.&#xA0;Historically, it is also the most Burmese of the country's large cities. Mandalay's Buddhist monasteries are among the most important in the country; about 60% of all the monks in Myanmar reside in the Mandalay area.&#xA0;The city takes its name from Mandalay Hill, 236 meters/774 feet high that rises just to the northeast of Mandalay Fort and its royal palace. Kyauktawgyi Pagoda was constructed between 1853 and 1878; and chiefly interesting for the huge seated image of the Buddha carved from a single block of marble.&#xA0;The marble block from the mines of nearby Sagyin was so colossal that it required 10,000 men laboring for 13 days to transport it from a canal to its current site. Sandamani Paya is a cluster of slender whitewashed stupas. The Paya enshrines an iron image of the Buddha cast in 1802 by Bodawpaya and transported here from Amarapura in 1874.&#xA0;Mahamuni Paya, originally built in 1784 when a road paved with bricks was constructed from his palace to the paya's eastern gate. The centerpiece of the shrine is the highly venerated Mahamuni image that was transported to Myanmar from Mrauk U in Rakhaing in 1784. Kuthodaw Paya is where the central stupa was modeled on the Shwezigon Paya near Bagan. &#xA0;Building began in 1857, at the same time as the royal palace, and it has been dubbed 'the world's biggest book', for standing around the central pa are 729 marble slabs on which are inscribed the entire Tripitaka. Mandalay Hill offers an easy climb up the sheltered steps and has panoramic views over the palace, Mandalay and the paya-studded countryside. &lt;strong&gt;The Hotel By The Red Canal Mandalay &#x2013; Chin Suite (B&lt;/strong&gt;)&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0;Mandalay&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today, enjoy an excursion to Inwa, Sagaing and Amarapura. &#xA0;Inwa served as an ancient capital of Upper Burma for more than 400 years after the fall of Bagan.&#xA0;Ava Bridge was engineered by the British. The 16-span bridge dates from 1934 and was the only structure that crossed the Ayeyarwady River until 1998 when a new Chinese-engineered bridge was completed at Pyay. Travel over to Sagaing on the right bank, widely regarded as the religious center of Myanmar. The Sagaing Ridge is crowded with around 600 pagodas and monasteries, where more than 3,000 monks reside. There are also around 100 meditation centers in the area. Thabyedan Fort was the Burmese last defense against the British forces in the third Anglo-Burmese war in 1886. &lt;strong&gt;The Hotel By The Red Canal Mandalay &#x2013; Chin Suite (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

The lake&#x2019;s shore and islands has some 17 villages on stilts, mostly inhabited by the Intha people. &lt;strong&gt;Inle Princess Resort Inle Lake &#x2013; Princess Lake View Chalet (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Day 19: Siem Reap&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
The crowning jewel of Khmer architecture, Angkor Wat is the national symbol and the highlight of any visit to Cambodia. The largest, best preserved, and most religiously significant of the Angkor temples, Angkor impresses visitors both by its sheer scale and beautifully proportioned layout, as well as the delicate artistry of its carvings.&#xA0;To approach the temple, first cross the vast moat, continuing along a broad causeway lined with naga balustrades. As you enter the main building, ascend through a series of galleries and courtyard before reaching the central sanctuary, which offers beautiful views back over the causeway and across the surrounding countryside.&#xA0;On the way, stop to enjoy the intricate stone carvings that adorn nearly every surface, with some 1,700 Apsaras, or celestial dancers, sculpted into the walls. The outer gallery walls displays the longest continuous bas-relief in the world, which narrates stories from Hindu mythology, including the famous Churning of the Ocean of Milk.&#xA0;Angkor Wat is stunning at any time of the day, but sunrise and sunset are especially beautiful times to watch the play of light on the stones. Ta Prohm is one of the most popular attractions of Angkor as much of the jungle has not been cleared, and it looks very much as most of the Angkor monuments would have appeared when European explorers first stumbled across them. &#xA0;Seemingly miniature in comparison to the other Angkor temples, Banteay Srei Is considered the jewel of classical Khmer art. &#xA0;Built in pink sandstone, the walls are covered in exquisitely preserved carvings of unusual delicacy.&#xA0; Because of its small size, fairy-like atmosphere and extraordinary examples of Khmer sculpture, this temple is often a favorite with visitors.&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Hotel De La Paix &#x2013; Duplex Spa Suite (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 20: Siem Reap &#x2013; Koh Ker&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you have a full day excursion to Koh Ker* and Beng Mealea.&#xA0; Koh Ker was once capital of Jayavarman IV.&#xA0;&#xA0;It features the pyramidal Prasat Thom.&#xA0; Beng Mealea, a 12th-century temple the size of Angkor about 40 kilometers from the Bayon.&#xA0; Beng Mealea is enclosed by a moat measuring 1200 by 900 meters.&#xA0; The temple is currently being reclaimed from the jungle as years of conflict in the region left it neglected and almost forgotten.&#xA0; It is now one of the most popular remote temples owing to its wealth of classical bas reliefs.&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0; Hotel De La Paix &#x2013; Duplex Spa Suite (B) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;*The Spirit of Big Five Foundation supports the nonprofit Heritage Watch organization in preserving and protecting these important ruins from looting and vandalism while helping the local community realize benefits through sustainable tourism.&lt;/em&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 21: Siem Reap / Bangkok / Depart &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Lima, Peru&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Welcome to Peru!&#xA0; Upon arrival in Lima, you proceed through Immigration and Customs. &#xA0;After claiming your luggage, exit the Customs Hall where a representative from Big Five will be waiting to assist you and transfer you to the airport hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Costa Del Sol Ramada Hotel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Return to the airport for your morning flight to Arequipa.&#xA0; You are welcomed on arrival and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; Today you tour Arequipa including the Santa Catalina.&#xA0; Arequipa is, arguably, the most beautiful colonial city in all of Peru, and the second largest.&#xA0; Known as the &#x201C;White City,&#x201D; Arequipa is in southern Peru at an elevation of approximately 7,500 feet.&#xA0;&#xA0; It is surrounded by the towering peaks of El Misti, Chachani and Picchu Picchu.&#xA0; The city tour takes in the Plaza de Armas, surrounding villages and countryside, the La Mansion del Fundador and El Molino de Sabandia. &#xA0;Then continue to La Compania.&#xA0; You finish with a visit to the 16th-century Convent of Santa Catalina, which was closed to outside visitors for almost 400 years, only reopening in 1970.&#xA0; This magnificent convent has been the scene of many historic and religious events.&#xA0; The architecture, art and furnishings hark back to the late 1500s.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Libertador Hotel Arequipa (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Arequipa / Chivay, Colca Canyon&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

After an early start and a hearty breakfast, set out on your last day of the trek.&#xA0; Climb uphill for two to three hours towards Llactapata pass (2,700 m/8,900 ft), where you come upon a distant but quite special view of Machu Picchu from the southwest, a view few tourists ever glimpse.&#xA0; Here, too, are the Llactapata Ruins, which have recently been restored.&#xA0; Lunch is provided at the observatory, with&#xA0; views of Machu Picchu.&#xA0; The final descent goes down to Aobamba River through lush bamboo forests, orchards and coffee plantations, which takes about two to three hours.&#xA0; Aguas Calientes and Machu Picchu are a short, scenic train ride away.&#xA0; The total hiking time is between four to six hours. &#xA0;(Hiking level: moderate to challenging).&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>Kenya &amp; Tanzania: View from Here, East Africa by Horseback</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&#x201C;I love being able to go on safari and know that in a short while, the ground will look as though I had never visited. That&#x2019;s why I am drawn to solar powered camps in the conservancies of East Africa or the idea of mobile camping.&#xA0; As a child in Kenya, I used to ride horses in school and remember very clearly how amazing the bush experience was when there were no crowds, and no clamoring of diesel power tour buses.&#xA0; This unique safari experience through Kenya and part of Tanzania is designed to take you back to the first experiences I had growing up, where you can see the wild in pure innocence.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Ashish Sanghrajka, President&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Experience Africa as early settlers would have&#x2026; on horseback, exploring the Chyulu Hills&#x2019; stunning scenery, big game and wildlife-rich ecosystems during a five-day riding safari&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Savor the experience of a mobile camp, each night riding to a new locale&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;In addition to a horseback exploration of Tanzania&#x2019;s Manyara Ranch, you also enjoy classic game viewing drives in Tarangire National Park and the renowned Ngorongoro Crater&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;In private conservancies, participate in walking safaris and night drives for a completely different perspective not allowed in national parks&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Engage with traditional Maasai warriors and learn about their customs&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Kilimanjaro, Tanzania / Arusha&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Welcome to Kilimanjaro International Airport.&#xA0; After exiting the Customs &amp;amp; Immigrations Hall, you will be met by a Big Five Tours &amp;amp; Expeditions driver/guide who will assist you with your luggage.&#xA0; Then transfer you to the lovely Arusha Coffee Lodge, located in one of Tanzania&#x2019;s largest coffee plantations.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Arusha Coffee Lodge&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Arusha / Tarangire National Park / Manyara Ranch Conservancy&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, depart overland to Tarangire National Park, complete with picnic lunch.&#xA0; Tarangire is home to great herds of elephant.&#xA0; During the dry season up to 300 can be found along the dry river bed, digging for underground streams.&#xA0; Migratory wildebeest, zebra, buffalo, impala, gazelle, hartebeest and eland flock to the remaining pools.&#xA0; In&#xA0;the rainy season, the animals spread out over 12,500 square miles.&#xA0; The swamps serve as host to 550 bird varieties.&#xA0; The park extends into two game-controlled areas so the wildlife can move freely.&#xA0; Following your game activities, head into what some call the future of safaris in Tanzania, Manyara Ranch, a 35,000-acre wildlife conservancy situated in the corridor between Tarangire and Manyara National Park.&#xA0; Originally established as a cattle ranch during Tanzania's colonial period, Manyara Ranch remains an operating ranch with a relatively small herd of beef cattle and black-headed sheep.&#xA0; In 2000, the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) obtained management and conservation rights to the ranch to protect these wildlife corridors.&#xA0; In so doing, they established a working relationship with the traditional landowners, the local Maasai, developing community conservation projects and rehabilitating the ranch itself.&#xA0; The ranch is held in trust by the Tanzania Land Conservation Trust for the benefit of the local communities and Tanzania.&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Manyara Ranch Conservancy (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3 &amp;amp; 4: &#xA0;Manyara Ranch Conservancy&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Your experience here will be like none other, the conservancy provides guided game walks, day and night drives, and visits to partner villages (in an authentic setting).&#xA0; But a highlight here is a horseback exploration that takes guests out to ride with big game in the company of experienced guides.&#xA0; Enjoy bush breakfast and dinners and participative research activities to promote on-going conservation projects in collaboration with the African Wildlife Foundation.&#xA0; Manyara Ranch is composed of a variety of habitats, from open savannah, to acacia woodland, to bush and riverine forest that support a large diversity of wildlife, including groups of large bull elephants, breeding herds of giraffe, many lesser kudu, wildebeest, zebra, gazelle, oryx and eland.&#xA0; There are also predators, including lion, cheetah, leopard, hyena, jackal and bat-eared foxes.&#xA0; For many years, wild dogs have denned on the ranch.&#xA0; The resident game population is continually increased as wildlife moves through these migratory corridors.&#xA0; The large number of bird species includes many raptors.&#xA0; There are several large dams on the ranch that attract and retain wildlife within the conservancy area.&#xA0; On one of the days, your safari&#xA0; leads to an unforgettable night spent in a mobile fly camp.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Manyara Ranch Conservancy (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Manyara Ranch Conservancy / Ngorongoro Crater / Manyara Ranch Conservancy&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Indulge your sense of personal discovery as you near Ngorongoro Crater.&#xA0; In 1892, a German explorer was the first European to record seeing the crater.&#xA0; You will approach it in much the same way he did.&#xA0; Certainly one of the world&#x2019;s most remarkable natural wonders, the crater&#x2019;s steep unbroken rim drops some 2,000 feet into a 102-square-mile basin.&#xA0;&#xA0; This may have been one of the world&#x2019;s tallest mountains until about two million years ago, when a massive volcano exploded, collapsing in on itself forming the massive crater.&#xA0; Today, Maasai pastoralists and their grazing cattle and goats share this landscape with 30,000 resident animals &#x2013; lions, elephants, rhinos, wildebeest, and so much more. The day&#x2019;s focus is the crater floor, reached by driving a rocky track down the steep side.&#xA0; Game viewing here is excellent throughout the year.&#xA0; You come startlingly close to some of the crater&#x2019;s lions.&#xA0; This dramatic setting is where you savor your picnic lunch with buffalo, zebra, reedbuck and rhinos.&#xA0; Large flocks of flamingos hang out around the lake in the bottom of the crater. Return to your camp later this afternoon. &lt;strong&gt;Manyara Ranch Conservancy (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Manyara Ranch Conservancy / Kilimanjaro / Nairobi / Olare Orok Conservancy (Masai Mara)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Arrive at Manyara airstrip for your short flight back to Kilimanjaro airport, where you take another short flight to Nairobi.&#xA0; From there, you fly to the famed Masai Mara Game Reserve in Kenya, enjoying the panoramas of the Great Rift Valley.&#xA0; The Masai Mara Game Reserve is Kenya's most precious wildlife sanctuary.&#xA0; On arrival, you are transferred to your camp, one of just three camps currently operating within the private Olare Orok Conservancy.&#xA0; Your safari experience is enhanced by the fact that private conservancies have the lowest vehicle density &#x2013; no mini-buses and only one guest room per 700 acres!&#xA0;&#xA0; Here, you escape the high tourist density found in national parks and reserves like the Masai Mara.&#xA0; Yet they retain the diversity of wildlife. Until recently, Olare Orok&#x2019;s 30,000 acres of prime rolling grasslands and riverine forest were filled with rural homesteads and large herds of cattle and goats.&#xA0; The ecosystem was being overgrazed, risking the sustenance of both wildlife and domestic cattle, and to the detriment of both.&#xA0; Sustainability was at risk for both the people and the wildlife.&#xA0; Today, the homesteads, cattle and goats have moved, and herd sizes have been reduced accordingly.&#xA0; The conservancy has become a haven for big cats as well as a migration route and now offers some of East Africa's finest year-round game viewing.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Mara Plains Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7 &amp;amp; 8: &#xA0;Olare Orok Conservancy&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
During morning and afternoon game drives, you explore savannas spotted with herds of buffalo, wildebeest, hartebeest, impala and gazelle.&#xA0; Dense thorn bush may hide browsing black rhino, and large numbers of giraffe and elephant patrol the edge of the woods.&#xA0; Hippos gather in the Mara River.&#xA0; Here, lion prides may be up to 20 strong.&#xA0; Night game drives offer a whole different atmosphere and feel of the bush as your search the darkness for elusive nocturnal species.&#xA0; Walking safaris are permitted in the conservancy, which is not true of the national parks.&#xA0; Walking the savannah in the company of a Maasai tracker gives you an entirely new experience of the African bush.&#xA0; If desired, you are also welcome to visit the Koiyaki Guide School, the only guide school in the region allowing young Maasai warriors an opportunity to enter the tourism industry, while allowing the young man to continue the traditions of his community.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Mara Plains Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; Olare Orok Conservancy / Chyulu Hills&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Fly into Ol Donyo Lodge airstrip, where you are met by a guide at the airstrip before enjoying a short game drive to the first campsite nestled in thick acacia woodland.&#xA0; The Chyulu Hills offer some of the most stunning scenery in Africa; rolling extinct volcanic hills, acacia forests, and grassy plains all in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro. This first game drive serves as an introduction to the area and its inhabitants; there are 38-recorded species of large mammals here and over 300 species of bird.&#xA0; Upon arrival into camp, you will have a brief camp orientation and introduction to the overall safari itinerary before enjoying lunch. This is where your horseback riding adventure really begins.&#xA0; You drive to the main stables of Ride Kenya main stables to meet the horses and staff.&#xA0; The riders are matched with horses, and then assessed as a group in a fenced arena, before heading out into the bush. (This riding program is not recommended for novice or non-riders.)&#xA0; The first afternoon ride sets off from the stables, and is designed to introduce riders to their horses and to the local ecosystem.&#xA0; You will pass through thick acacia forest, and out onto the savannah.&#xA0; Expect to ride at a variety of speeds and to see game such as giraffe, impala, elephant, warthog and gazelle.&#xA0; Arrive into your mobile camp at dusk. Relax and enjoy a drink by the fire, a hot shower and a three-course dinner. As the sun goes down, listen to the jackal and hyena calling as they commence their nocturnal hunts.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ride Kenya Mobile Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10:&#xA0; Chyulu Hills&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Depart at dawn on horseback for a morning exploration of the forest and savannah around camp.&#xA0; The forest is thick with umbrella-shaped acacia tortilis, where giraffe browse and antelope abound. The dawn chorus of birdsongs rings in the background as you and your horse set in the first light of the new day.&#xA0; The footing is ideal for horse riding; coarse volcanic soil that is firm yet forgiving under hoof, allowing riders an opportunity to enjoy the horses&#x2019; schooling and fitness; long trots and canters can be supplemented with some cross-country style jumping over fallen trees and fences, for the more skilled riders. As nomadic Maasai people own the land here, you will ride past some villages. The traditional Maasai culture is fascinating to see first-hand.&#xA0; Emerge from the forest, and traverse the wide-open Mbirikani plains, dotted with wildlife. The plains stretch for 70 miles before Mount Kilimanjaro rises up on the distant horizon.&#xA0; Enjoy a full English breakfast under the shade of an acacia tree before riding back to camp.&#xA0; A few hours rest in the heat of the day follows a late lunch in camp.&#xA0; Tonight, an evening walk is offered to stretch out riding muscles, and to learn more about the local flora and fauna. There is even a chance to track and locate some of the forest&#x2019;s resident bull elephants; several of which are known to be the largest elephant &#x2018;tuskers&#x2019; left in Africa today.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ride Kenya Mobile Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11:&#xA0; Chyulu Hills / Chyulu East National Park&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Leave camp early on horseback and proceed through the acacia forest up towards Chyulu East National Park.&#xA0; Taking a packed breakfast in the saddlebags allows the ride to be flexible and to enjoy wandering with the game on their daily movements. Kicking up wildlife in the forest is thrilling; from small sightings like flocks of guinea-fowl, pairs of dik-dik or packs of jackal, to the huge bulk of a herd of eland, oryx or elephant.&#xA0; The ride soon leaves the thick acacia forests, and begins to pass through seemingly endless stands of whistling thorn acacia on the ascent up into the Chyulu Hills. This is a place to see cheetah, gerenuk, zebra, wildebeest and Coke&#x2019;s hartebeest. This morning&#x2019;s ride is long, exciting and fast, with plenty of chance to canter, gallop and jump.&#xA0; The ride ascends about 2,000 feet above the plains with stunning views stretching for 90 miles on a clear day.&#xA0; Arrive into Crater camp for a late lunch. This camp is nestled into a forest next to a large extinct volcanic crater, overlooking the quintessential East African plains that lead up to Mount Kilimanjaro.&#xA0; In the later afternoon, take the opportunity to climb the volcanic crater in pursuit of a sighting the very rare Verreaux&#x2019;s Eagle, which nests in the nearly inaccessible rocky outcrops at the rim.&#xA0; Or, explore the lava tubes under the crater, which lie within walking distance of the camp.&#xA0; These jagged caves stretch for miles as they lead away from the crater and have been used for generations of hunter-gatherers as shelter.&#xA0; Enjoy sunset in this most spectacular campsite.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ride Kenya Mobile Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 12:&#xA0; Chyulu East National Park / Mist Forest&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Depart after breakfast on today&#x2019;s ride as you ascend another 2,000 feet higher into the Chyulu Hills.&#xA0; There is a noticeable change in climate and temperature as you reach over 7,000 feet above sea level. The ride is dominated by incredible vistas of the vast wilderness of Tsavo East National Park to the east, and Mount Kilimanjaro and Amboseli National Park to the west.&#xA0; Today&#x2019;s riding traverses steep slopes and valleys and you may need to lead your horse at times.&#xA0; Due to the altitude of the area, clouds often sit on the top of the Chyulu Hills.&#xA0; Consistent moisture has created pockets of mist forest that dot the summits of the hills.&#xA0; Enjoy a picnic lunch just outside one of the largest mist forests.&#xA0; After lunch, set out to explore this fascinating environment on foot in search of buffalo, leopard, Syke&#x2019;s monkey and the giant forest hog.&#xA0; Back on the horses, you ride down out of the hills, passing a few subsistence farmers&#x2019; villages en route.&#xA0; Most of the farmers are Kamba people, who make a living with maize farming on the hillside.&#xA0; Rural school children are likely to spot the horses and follow them for a while, giggling and running along beside. Arrive in the late afternoon to Olecuto Camp.&#xA0; Enjoy a well-earned drink and rest in stunning scenery.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt; Ride Kenya Mobile Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 13 &amp;amp; 14:&#xA0; Mist Forest&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
The next two days, you explore the forests of Olecutu on horseback.&#xA0; This beautiful and remote area supports herds of giraffe, gazelle, zebra and wildebeest. You may spot ostrich and Kori bustard bathing in the red dust.&#xA0; You discover the Inchalai Swamps, where breeding herds of elephant come to drink at night.&#xA0; You might catch the elephants returning to the thick lava flow where they seek refuge during the day.&#xA0; Maasai herdsmen and women also bring their livestock to the swamps for water.&#xA0; Enjoy a barbecue lunch atop rocky outcroppings before riding out across the vast savannah to the camp. &lt;strong&gt;Ride Kenya Mobile Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 15: &#xA0;Chyulu Hills / Nairobi / Depart&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you will fly to Nairobi&#x2019;s Wilson Airport in Nairobi.&#xA0; Upon arrival, you are greeted and transferred to a local restaurant for lunch.&#xA0; Continue to your hotel where a dayroom awaits for your convenience.&#xA0; This afternoon, visit the Daphne Sheldrick Elephant Trust and Orphanage, where you will have a heart-warming, VIP visit to see an orphaned baby elephant or rhino that has been fostered by Big Five on your behalf.&#xA0; After a farewell dinner, you will transfer to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to board your departing flight home.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ole Sereni Hotel - Dayroom (B,L,D)&#xD;

Today you savor a full day tour of Beijing.&#xA0; First, Tiananmen Square at the center of Beijing where you can see Tiananmen Tower, Monument to the People's Heroes, Great Hall of the People, Mao Zedong Memorial Hall and see the national flag raising ceremony. &#xA0;Thousands of people come to this massive square every day.&#xA0; Then, the phenomenal Forbidden City, at the city&#x2019;s heart, was the imperial palace during the Ming and Qing dynasties.&#xA0; Now known as the Palace Museum, it is to the north of Tiananmen Square.&#xA0; Rectangular in shape, it is the world's largest palace complex and covers 74 hectares/7,965 square feet.&#xA0; Surrounded by a six-meter deep moat and a ten-meter high wall are 9,999 rooms.&#xA0; The wall has a gate on each side.&#xA0; Opposite the Tiananmen Gate to the north is the Gate of Divine Might (Shenwumen), which faces Jingshan Park.&#xA0; The distance between these two gates is 960 meters/3,150 feet while the distance between the gates in the east and west walls is 750 meters/2,461 feet.&#xA0; There are unique and delicately structured towers on each of the four corners of the curtain wall. &#xA0;These afford views over both the palace and the city outside.&#xA0; Next travel to the Summer Palace set along Kunming Lake.&#xA0; Situated in the western outskirts of Haidian District, the palace is 15 kilometers/9.3 miles from central Beijing.&#xA0; Containing examples of the ancient arts, it also has graceful landscapes and magnificent constructions.&#xA0; A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the palace is the archetypal Chinese garden, and is ranked amongst the most noted and classical gardens of the world.&#xA0; Finally stop by Sihui to see where China&#x2019;s Grand Canal originates in Beijing.&#xA0; This is the longest canal or artificial river in the world, and it passes through Tianjin and several provinces to the city of Hangzhou.&#xA0; The oldest parts of the canal date back to the 5th century BC, although the various sections were finally combined during the Sui Dynasty (581&#x2013;618 AD).&#xA0; The total length of the Grand Canal is 1,776 km/1,104 mi.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Fairmont Beijing (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: &#xA0;Beijing &#x2013; Great Wall of China&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, you set out to explore one of the most amazing manmade structures in the world... the Great Wall of China.&#xA0; You travel to the Mutianyu Section, which is far less touristy that other segments.&#xA0; Many dynasties in Chinese history actively built walls in this area.&#xA0; Among many historical ruins of the Great Wall in Beijing, the wall built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 DC) is the most often seen and best preserved, running over 600 kilometers/373 miles and containing about 827 city wall platforms, 71 passes and countless towers.&#xA0; Today you will visit the Mutianyu Section of the wall in Huairou County, about 45 miles from Beijing.&#xA0; This section of the wall connects Juyongguan Pass in the west and Gubeikou Great Wall in the east.&#xA0; The wall was first built in Northern Qi Dynasty (550-557DC).&#xA0; In the reign of the Ming Dynasty, two famous patriotic generals rebuilt it in order to strengthen its defensive potential when they guarded the strategic pass.&#xA0; It served as the northern protective screen, guarding the capital and imperial mausoleums for generations.&#xA0; Later, you enjoy a delightful lunch at a local school house before continuing to the Sacred Way.&#xA0; The Emperor, known as the Son of the Heaven, is said to have traveled from heaven to his country through the Sacred Way; and also would return along the same route through this road.&#xA0; The road is often lined with stone statues, important decorations of the mausoleum.&#xA0; These statues are usually 12 human figures (including a general, civil officials and meritorious officials) and 24 animals, including lion, camel, elephant, xiezhi (a mythological unicorn), qilin (one of the four "divine animals, the other three are dragon, phoenix and tortoise), and horse.&#xA0; From here, you drive to the National Stadium (Bird&#x2019;s Nest) in Olympic Green Village in the Chaoyang District of the city.&#xA0; It was designed as the main stadium of 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, where events of track and field, football, gavelock, weight throwing and discus were held.&#xA0; Now it serves as the center of international or domestic sports competition and recreation activities.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Fairmont Beijing (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Beijing / Zhenjiang&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today, you are escorted to the train station to board your first class train to Zhenjiang, an almost five-hour journey.&#xA0; Upon arrival in Zhenjiang, you will be met and transferred to your hotel where you will have dinner and a leisurely evening.&#xA0; Zhenjiang lies on the south bank of the lower Yangtze River, and in the southwest of Jiangsu Province.&#xA0; The recorded history of Zhenjiang could be traced back 3,000 years to the Zhou Dynasty (11th century BC-221BC).&#xA0; Zhenjiang is also the home of the Jing-Hang section of the Grand Canal.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Sheraton&#xA0;Zhenjiang Hotel (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Zhenjiang / Yangzhou&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, discover the Xijin Old Port, the former British Consulate in the Qing Dynasty.&#xA0; Xijin Ancient Street at the foot of Yuntai Mountain, the south of the city, was originally built in the Sixth Dynasty and flourished during the Tang and Song Dynasties.&#xA0; It has been awarded the Distinguished Protection Project of Cultural Heritage of United Nations.&#xA0; This fascinating street is host to many ancient relics such as Guanyin Cave, Xijin Ancient Ferry, and the most-protected and oldest stone pagoda in China.&#xA0; There are more than 150 shops along Xijin Ancient Street.&#xA0; You visit the museum of Ms. Pearl S. Buck, who in 1938 became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in literature.&#xA0; She was a prolific American writer, and is most famous for her book The Good Earth based on the life of a Chinese village.&#xA0; The next stop is the Zhenjiang Hengshun Vinegar Factory, founded in the Qing Dynasty, 1840AD.&#xA0; This is where the Chinese vinegar industry began, and is also a National Intangible Cultural Heritage Site.&#xA0; Here, you can learn about the artistry of making vinegar.&#xA0; Drive to Yangzhou and check in to your hotel.&#xA0; This evening you will have time for a relaxing and welcomed foot massage.&#xA0; Yangzhou ranks as the best city in the country for foot massages.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ramada Plaza Yangzhou Casa (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; Shanghai&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you will enjoy a full day city tour of Shanghai.&#xA0; First stop is the Bund, the city&#x2019;s famous waterfront serving as the symbol of Shanghai for hundreds of years.&#xA0; It is on the west bank of Huangpu River from the Waibaidu Bridge to Nanpu Bridge.&#xA0; It is less than a mile long, but is most famous for its 26 buildings of different architectural styles including Gothic, Baroque, Romanesque, Classicism and the Renaissance.&#xA0; The 1,700-meter/1,859-yard flood-control wall, also known as 'the lovers' wall', is located on the side of Huangpu River from Huangpu Park to Xinkai River.&#xA0; After renovation, the monotone concrete buildings that lovers leaned against in the past have been improved into hollowed-out railings full of romantic atmosphere.&#xA0; Standing by the railings, visitors can have a 'snap-shot' view of the scenery of Pudong Area and Huangpu River.&#xA0; Lunch today will be served at Jean Gorges Restaurant at 3 on the Bund before you visit the Shanghai Museum (optional:&#xA0; subject to availability, you may invite the principal secretary of the Museum to join you for your tour).&#xA0; Located in the center of Shanghai in People's Square, Shanghai Museum has a large museum of ancient Chinese art.&#xA0; The museum style and presentation surround visitors with artifacts demonstrating ancient wisdom and philosophy.&#xA0; The exterior design of the round dome and the square base symbolize the ancient ideas of a round heaven and a square land.&#xA0; The museum is divided into eleven galleries that cover most of the major categories of Chinese art:&#xA0; Ancient Bronze, Ancient Ceramics, Paintings, Calligraphy, Ancient Sculpture, Ancient Jade, Coins, Ming and Qing Furniture, Seals, and Minority Nationalities.&#xA0; This afternoon is at your leisure to explore the Tian Zi Fang area of the French Concession.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Fairmont Peace Hotel (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>Custom Ecuador &amp; The Galapagos Tour</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Ecuador &amp;amp;&#xA0;The Galapagos&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Rainforest:&lt;/strong&gt; The largest unexplored wilderness on earth, the Amazon basin encompasses seven million square kilometers/1.7 billion acres. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations, including Ecuador. The Amazon represents over half of the planet&#x2019;s rainforests.&#xA0; Wildlife activities range from fishing for piranhas, to looking for freshwater pink dolphins, to visiting a local community where people generously share their traditions and ancestral knowledge of medicinal plants.&#xA0; Excursions include a trip to a salt lick that attracts hundreds of parrots, optional fishing and exploring by dugout canoe.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Antisana Ecological Reserve:&lt;/strong&gt; This sanctuary for the endangered Andean condor sits amid the magnificent landscapes around snow-covered Antisana Volcano, at 5,758 meters/18,886 feet. &#xA0;The Andean condor is the national symbol of Ecuador, and conservation efforts are underway to save one of the last populations of the world&#x2019;s largest flying bird.&#xA0; What began as a local movement now has national and international support. &#xA0;The refuge is also home to the black-faced ibis, Andean lapwings and the rare siskin.&#xA0; Glaciers feed the region&#x2019;s lakes and rivers and provide much of Quito&#x2019;s drinking water.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Avenue Of The Volcanoes:&lt;/strong&gt; &#x201C;Avenue Of The Volcanoes&#x201D; is a more than 200-milelong valley with massive volcanoes that provide snow-covered contrast to the green equatorial highlands and jungle.&#xA0; Ecuador is part of a Pacific Ring of volcanoes named &#x201C;Ring Of Fire.&#x201D; All of Ecuador&#x2019;s major mountains are volcanic. &#xA0;Cotopaxi and Antisana volcanoes are part of this chain.&#xA0; Cotopaxi in the Andes is one of the highest at 5,896 meters/19,347 feet.&#xA0; The town of Ba&#xF1;os has a beautiful basilica and hot springs.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Cuenca:&lt;/strong&gt; Archeological discoveries suggest that the first inhabitants may go as far back as 8060 BC. The first settlement was a Ca&#xF1;ari settlement believed to have been founded around 500 AD.&#xA0; Nearby are the Ingapirca Ruins, the largest Incan site in Ecuador. &#xA0;The most significant building is the temple of the sun, an elliptical-shaped structure made without mortar and positioned so that sunlight fell through the center of the doorway of the small chamber atop the temple during the solstices.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Galapagos Islands:&lt;/strong&gt; Composed almost exclusively of volcanic rock, the Galapagos Islands sit west of mainland Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean. &#xA0;The islands can be explored either on a cruise or from one of the island hotels. While a specific itinerary depends on the choice of hotel, ship, length of cruise and seasonal factors, all journeys share common elements. &#xA0;Travelers explore ecosystems that, at first, appear desolate. &#xA0;Yet, these rough isles are home to strange and abundant wildlife.&#xA0; Giant Galapagos tortoises amble through the highlands and prehistoric marine iguanas sun themselves on black lava rocks. Flightless cormorants and tiny penguins dart through the waters.&#xA0; Close-up encounters with wildlife, islands hikes, snorkeling and swimming make for an extraordinary island adventure.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Indigenous Highlands Markets:&lt;/strong&gt; Indigenous markets where local farmers sell their goods are found throughout the highlands, including in Otavalo, Pujil&#xED;, Saquisil&#xED;, Latacunga, Zumbahua, Salasacas. Some markets such as Otavalo and Saquisil&#xED; are famous for brilliantly colored textiles, handicrafts, pottery, baskets, wooden crafts and exotic fruits.&#xA0; Markets are wonderful places to learn about native foods as well as gain insight into the region&#x2019;s rich culture and traditions.&#xA0; The Otavale&#xF1;os were textile makers before the Incan invasion in the 15th century. &#xA0;Some villages specialize in a specific craft such as Cotacachi noted for leather and San Antonio for woodcarving.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kapawi Ecological Private Reserve:&lt;/strong&gt; This reserve is part of the biologically diverse Amazon.&#xA0; Kapawi is a remote eco-lodge in the land of the Achuar people, a vibrant indigenous culture. &#xA0;The lodge was built using native techniques and materials. &#xA0;It is designed to help support and preserve the Achuar way of life and habitat.&#xA0; Activities are tailored to each guest, and include hikes, canoe trips, piranha fishing and visits to the Achuar village.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Mashpi Private Reserve:&lt;/strong&gt; At 900 meters/3,116 feet above sea level, this lush private reserve is surrounded by lower rainforest and cloud forest with a profusion of plants from ferns to hundreds of orchid species, many newly discovered.&#xA0; Some 500 species of birds have been identified. &#xA0;Monkeys, peccaries and even pumas live here.&#xA0; One of the highlights is an aerial tram that glides through the forest canopy.&#xA0; An aerial bicycle is an original and exciting way to explore the forest canopy up close.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Pacific Coast:&lt;/strong&gt; Ecuador&#x2019;s coast is a composition of lush mangrove forests, jungle, crystal clear waters, stunning white sandy beaches and quaint fishing villages. &#xA0;It is not heavily visited, yet offers good wildlife viewing, whale watching and surfing.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Quito:&lt;/strong&gt; Ecuador&#x2019;s scenic capital feels like a city of perpetual spring nestled in a valley amid snow-tipped mountains. It is a charming city of baroque splendor and handsomely preserved colonial landmarks. The genteel heart of the city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recalls another era with cobblestone streets, superb churches, open plazas, ornate balconies, tile roofs and central patios. UNESCO lists the 17th-century Church of La Compa&#xF1;&#xED;a among 100 most important World Heritage Site Monuments.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Riobamba &amp;amp; Devil&#x2019;s Nose Train:&lt;/strong&gt; This indigenous community has a local handcraft center that has managed to remain unknown to most travelers. Visitors can ride the Devil&#x2019;s Nose Train as it zigzags up a mountainside, across bridges and gorges, and through tunnels.&#xD;
&#xD;

&lt;h4&gt;Best Time to Travel to Ecuador &amp;amp; The Galapagos&#xD;
Festivals &amp;amp; Special Events&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The Highlands&#x2019; dry winter runs from June to September, while the Amazon Basin&#x2019;s dry season is from May to November.&#xA0; However, Ecuador can be visited year round.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;May to December is fine in the Galapagos Islands. March through May, and November and December are ideal. July, August and December are high season, therefore pricier.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Carnival is celebrated in February/March, during the week before Lent, ending on Ash Wednesday.&#xA0; Most children and teenagers celebrate by throwing water balloons, bags of flour and even eggs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Corpus Christi is Thursday after Trinity Sunday. &#xA0;It is popular in the highland provinces, and is celebrated according to each town&#x2019;s traditions. &#xA0;For example, in Cotopaxi, masked men dance in the streets with 40-foot tall greased poles, which men must climb to get prizes at the top.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Fiestas de Quito. On the weeks leading up to December 6th, a party atmosphere descends on Quito.&#xA0; Businesses go on half-day schedules.&#xA0; The 6th of December commemorates Ecuadorian colonial identity &#x2013; a mix of Andean inspired local culture and classic Spanish tradition, with bullfighting as the main focus.&#xA0; This may be the most important and traditional bullfighting affair of the Americas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Chobe National Park/Linyanti Wildlife Reserve: &lt;/strong&gt;In northwest Botswana, Chobe is an expansive wilderness with one of the largest game concentrations left on the African continent.&#xA0; Lion, leopard, wild dog, cheetah and zebra are here in healthy numbers, but the elephant is the star. &#xA0;As part of the largest continuous elephant herd left in the world, the population is estimated at 120,000, covering most of northern Botswana and northwestern Zimbabwe.&#xA0; They migrate from Chobe and Linyanti rivers in the dry season to the southeast pans during the rains.&#xA0; They are the largest in body size of all elephants. Linyanti Wildlife Reserve, on the Linyanti River, is an exclusive private reserve of 275,000 acres.&#xA0; It is less crowded than Chobe can be. &#xA0;Its varied woodlands and floodplains are home to several species of antelope:&#xA0; roan, sable, the rare red lechwe, and aquatic sitatunga.&#xA0; It is also known for massive herds of elephant. &#xA0;Great herds of zebra graze here before trekking south in November.&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Makgadikgadi Pans:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;Makgadikgadi Pans have a fascinating geological history.&#xA0; The area was once part of an ancient lake that dried up some 10,000 years ago.&#xA0; It is composed of many pans with sandy desert in between.&#xA0; The pans are like no other place on Earth &#x2013; utterly desolate until the rains come between December and April.&#xA0; The largest single pan is about 1,930 square miles, and is often covered with water. &#xA0;Makgadikgadi Pans is the largest salt flat complex in the world.&#xA0; The area is home to one of Africa's biggest zebra populations.&#xA0; In the dry season, the Boteti River on the edge of the pans becomes very important in providing an area for wildlife to congregate, since most seasonal ponds and drainages are devoid of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Mashatu Game Reserve:&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;In a remote corner of Botswana, where the Limpopo and Shashe rivers meet, Mashatu Game Reserve boasts a wilderness terrain of savannas, riverine forests, marshland, open plains and sandstone outcrops.&#xA0; The privately owned land shelters lion, giraffe, eland, cheetah, ostrich and kori bustard.&#xA0; At night, bat-eared fox, African wildcat and leopard search for prey.&#xA0; Some 366 species of birds have been identified.&#xA0; The reserve has the largest single population (more than 500) of elephants on privately owned land.&#xA0; In this brilliant setting, one can discover unspoiled landscapes in 4 x 4 vehicles, on walking safaris, by mountain bikes or horseback.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Mobile Safaris&lt;/strong&gt;: For the quintessential safari experience, mobile safaris explore a variety of bush landscapes from delta to grassy floodplains to massive salt flats. Game viewing is done on foot, by boat and in safari vehicles. They explore remote archaeological sites and fossil beds of extinct giant zebra and hippo. Guides are highly trained and experienced, including the renowned Bushmen, who share how they survive in this environment, using ancient knowledge of plants, animal behavior and their survival skills. Each day&#x2019;s journey is set to the rhythms of the land and the animals.Here is the opportunity to sleep out in the open, surrounded by nature at her very best.&#xD;
her very best.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Moremi Wildlife Reserve:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;Moremi is the centerpiece, the gem of the delta and one of the great African game-viewing parks.&#xA0; The wildlife is as varied as the ecosystems &#x2013; from lechwe, tsessebe and reedbuck that thrive in the floodplain to sable and roan antelope found along the streams.&#xA0; Lion and leopard are very active.&#xA0; Here, too, migrating elephant, buffalo, zebra and wildebeest gather around pools of water during the dry season.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Okavango Delta:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;This is the world's largest inland delta, and is seasonal habitat for elephant, blue wildebeest, giraffe, Nile crocodile, lion and hyenas as well as over 400 species of birds.&#xA0; It is subject to seasonal flooding, which can start as early as May, but generally floods do not reach many parts of the delta until mid-to late-June.&#xA0; July and August are the peak flood months.&#xA0; Seasonal water levels mean islands appear and disappear.&#xA0; The Okavango River, with no ocean outlet, is the source of the delta&#x2019;s water.&#xA0; The region is known for walking safaris and safaris by dugout canoe and boat (water levels permitting), as well as game drives.&#xD;

Festivals and Special Events:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;May-August is winter, the dry season with sunny, cool to warm days. &#xA0;Night temperatures can dip below freezing, especially in the southwest.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;June-October is prime time in the Okavango Delta, with animals migrating to water.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;March-April is when the zebras and others migrate to Chobe and Savuti.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;November-March is summer.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s hot and rainy, but a great time to spot birds and numbers of animals migrating to summer grazing areas.&#xA0; Mosquitoes can be a problem. &#xA0;Calving season is November-December.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Although summers are hot, December to April is an ideal time to see the migrating birdlife in the Kalahari Desert.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Myanmar&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) River:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most pleasant ways to discover a country is from its waterways, with the pulse beneath your feet as your ship glides along the river. &#xA0;Ancient monasteries, temple ruins, villages of bamboo huts slip past.&#xA0; As early as the sixth century the river was used for trade and transport. &#xA0;It remains the bloodline of this once isolated land, flowing north to south, emptying into the Andaman Sea. &#xA0;The river is still as vital today with goods and people traveling this liquid highway.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Bagan:&lt;/strong&gt; It may be hard to imagine this quiet town as the center of an empire that stretched from Tibet to Bangkok, Thailand.&#xA0; The city sits on a broad plain stretching away from Ayeyarwaddy River.&#xA0;It became the capital during the first Myanmar Empire, and entered its golden age about 1057.&#xA0; Thousands of pagodas and temples, dating from the 11th to 13th centuries, occupied a compact area of only about 41 square kilometers/16 square miles.&#xA0; During the 12th and 13th centuries, Bagan was a cosmopolitan center for Buddhist studies, attracting monks from as far as India. Schwezigon Pagoda was built to enshrine relicts of Buddha, with construction finished between 1086 and1090. The stupa&#x2019;s graceful bell shape became a prototype for later stupas.&#xA0; Ananda Pahto is one of the largest, best preserved and most revered of Bagan&#x2019;s temples. &#xA0;Thought to date around 1105, this perfectly proportioned temple heralds the stylistic end of Early Bagan period.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Inle Lake, Kakku &amp;amp; Kalaw:&lt;/strong&gt; Inle Lake is nestled in a small valley rimmed with tall hills in Shan state. The lake is dotted with islands and about 17 stilt villages.&#xA0; They are inhabited mostly by the Intha people, who carry on time honored lifestyles much as their grandparents did.&#xA0; On the western shore, a stair pathway leads to the Inn Thein Pagoda with hundreds of small stupas overgrown by weeds and greenery. &#xA0;Farmers still grow crops using traditional methods. &#xA0;Along a creek, past rice fields, is Sae Ma village, which has a primary school, where visitors can meet local children and teachers.&#xA0; Tha Lay is a village of weavers.&#xA0; Kakku is known for a remarkable site with more than 2,500 pagoda ruins. &#xA0;Legends date the site back to the third century BC and also to the 11th century.&#xA0; The stupas are decorated with stucco figures of mythical animals, celestial beings and floral motifs.&#xA0; The complex is deep inside the country of the indigenous Pa O community.&#xA0; Visiting the site requires an escort.&#xA0; Kalaw is a hill town in Shan that was popular with the British during colonial rule. &#xA0;In the rolling, pine-clad hills of the Shan Plateau, the town sits to the west of Inle Lake. &#xA0;Every five days, the hill tribe people come to town to buy and sell their goods.&#xA0; Kalaw is surrounded by hazy blue mountains with hiking trails.&#xA0; Some 300 species of birds occupy the forest.&#xA0; Ma Ha Mu Ni Hnyee Buddha statue was woven from bamboo strips 500 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kyaikhitiyo:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the place of the remarkable and mystical pagoda that is about five meters/18 feet tall and built upon a huge gold-painted boulder some 15.24 meters/50 feet in diameter.&#xA0; The boulder seems perilously balanced on the edge of the rock and separated from the mountain edge by a deep chasm.&#xA0; At a glance, it appears that the boulder will tumble off its perch with the slightest breeze.&#xA0; Indeed, it appears that a piece of thread placed under the rock passes through from one side of the boulder to the other side. The bolder has maintained this unlikely position for 2,500 years. &#xA0;A steep road winds up from the base camp to the pagoda on top.&#xA0; The legend of the shrine says that it houses a relic of Buddha &#x2013; hair of Gotama Buddha given to a hermit residing there by Buddha himself.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Mandalay:&lt;/strong&gt; Riverboat, trishaw and foot are still the main methods of transportation here; and water buffalo still work in the fields. Stories tell that Buddha foretold a great city of Buddhism would be founded at the base of this hill. In 1857, King Mindon chose to fulfill the prophecy by establishing a new kingdom. After the British occupied the city in 1885, the fort became the colony&#x2019;s government house and British Club. Mandalay Museum and Library contain fine examples of art and historic palm-leaf manuscripts. The 19th-century Kyauktawgyi Pagoda is famed for its huge seated Buddha carved from a single block of marble. The block required 10,000 men laboring for 13 days to transport it from a canal to its current site. On the bank of the Ayeyarwady River, Sagaing is the spiritual center of Myanmar, with 600 pagodas, more than 100 meditation centers and monasteries, home to 3,000 monks.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Ngapoli:&lt;/strong&gt; Long stretches of coast have beautiful beaches on Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Some 800 tropical islands dot the waters off the southern tip of the country. The rich marine life provides great diving and snorkeling. A deserted section of silver sand comes easy here. Ngapoli Beach stretches between two villages - Ngapoli and Gyeiktaw. There are villages nearby and small islands to explore as well as golf and spa facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Yangon:&lt;/strong&gt; Formally Rangoon, it served as Myanmar&#x2019;s capital from 1885 until about 2005, when a new city, Naypyidaw, became the administrative capital. Yangon remains the largest and the most important commercial center in Myanmar. Even so, its infrastructure is undeveloped compared to other major cities in Southeast Asia. It rests in the fertile delta of southern Myanmar on the slow Yangon River. With tree-lined boulevards, it is evocative of many of Southeast Asia&#x2019;s former colonial cities. It embraces the largest collection of colonial buildings in Southeast Asia. The national museum houses the Sihasana Lion Throne, used by the last Burmese king. The Buddhist Art Museum is located in a 1952 Art Deco-style building and features an amazing lotus window with all the attitudes of the Buddha.&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;h4&gt;Best Times to Travel to Myanmar&#xD;
Festivals &amp;amp; Special Events:&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The best time to visit is from November to March when temperatures are relatively low, averaging between 59&#xB0;F to 86&#xB0;F.&#xA0; In December and January, temperatures can drop to near freezing at night in the highlands of Kalaw and Inle Lake.&#xA0; In April and May, the hottest season, temperatures often rise to over 100&#xB0;F in Yangon, Mandalay and Bagan. Monsoon season begins between mid-May and mid-June, bringing frequent rains, especially in the southern and western regions that last until September.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Ananda Pagoda Festival, in December and January, in Bagan draws people from surrounding villages, who come to the fair to sell all manner of local goods from toy characters made of clay or paper, bamboo containers, brass items and more.&#xA0; Entertainment is provided by dancers, musicians, circus performers and actors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Thingyan Festival (Water Festival) comes in April just before the New Year. &#xA0;The three- or four-day festival is held throughout the country.&#xA0; People believe that pouring water over each other during Thingyan cleans out the sins from the old year.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Tazaungdaing Balloon Festival, usually in November, happens in Taunggyi in the state of Shan, and coincides with the national Thadingyut Festival of Lights, which celebrates the last month of Myanmar Lent, and the return of Buddha from heaven to earth. &#xA0;On the day before, during and the day after the full moon day, people around the country light millions of candles and hang colorful paper lanterns everywhere &#x2013; in monasteries, pagodas, houses and trees.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Cameron Highlands:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;Cameron Highlands is north of Kuala Lumpur, in Pahang, Malaysia.&#xA0; At 1,524 meters/5,000 feet, it offers a cool retreat. &#xA0;The highland district is ideal for growing strawberries, roses, vegetables and tea.&#xA0; It also has a butterfly farm, Brinchang Hindu Temples, Sam Poh Chinese Mahayana Buddhist Temple and Market Square.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kota Kinabalu:&lt;/strong&gt; Wildlife, diverse ethnic groups and exotic flora define the area.&#xA0; Dramatic caves are filled with impressive formations and specially adapted wildlife.&#xA0; It is the capital of Sabah state in East Malaysia.&#xA0; This industrial city is on the coast of Borneo facing the South China Sea.&#xA0; Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park lies on one side.&#xA0; Nearby Mt. Kinabalu is the highest mountain in Malaysia at 4,095 meters/1,3431feet. &#xA0;This is a gateway to Sabah and Borneo. &#xA0;Malaysia&#x2019;s first national park, Kinabalu National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a vital biological site with more than 4,500 species of flora and fauna. &#xA0;Padas River offers excellent whitewater rafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kuala Lumpur: &lt;/strong&gt;The capital city is the largest in Malaysia, encompassing some 43 square kilometers/94 square miles. &#xA0;It is the economic engine of the country. &#xA0;It is a designated global city, meaning that it is an important part of the global economic system.&#xA0; KL is the cultural hub of Malaysia and home to Petronas Philharmonic Hall and several museums including the National Art Museum.&#xA0; The Islamic Arts Museum houses more than 7,000 Islamic artifacts.&#xA0; Famous Petaling Street comes alive at night.&#xA0; The center of Kuala Lumpur&#x2019;s original Chinatown, Petaling Street, retains its old-style atmosphere, especially at night when vendor&#x2019;s wares, from food to toys to gems, flow out on the streets.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kuching: &lt;/strong&gt;The once-colonial city is the capital of Sarawak, Malaysia&#x2019;s largest state.&#xA0; All manner of traders landed in this port in the 19th century in search of exotic spices.&#xA0; The palace once belonged to the White Rajah (Englishman James Brooke). &#xA0;The White Rajahs ruled Sarawak from 1841 to 1946.&#xA0; The palace serves as the residence of the governor.&#xA0; Semonggok Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre, south of Kuching, is a sanctuary for injured and rescued orangutans. &#xA0;Semi-wild orangutans roam freely in the rainforest, often returning to the center at feeding time.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Miri: &lt;/strong&gt;Miri is the center of Malaysia&#x2019;s oil and gas industry, but tourism is also important focus.&#xA0; Miri has a diverse ecology with five national parks, including a marine park.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Mulu National Park:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;Near Miri, Sarawak in Borneo, this park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and famous for its cave system and karst formations.&#xA0; The park encompasses 51,800 hectares/128,000 acres of primary forest.&#xA0; Three mountains and towering limestone pinnacles dominate the scene.&#xA0; Here, too, are recordbreaking caves such as Sarawak Chamber, the world&#x2019;s largest enclosed space; Clearwater, longest cave in Southeast Asia; and Deer, world&#x2019;s largest cave entrance. &#xA0;In the early evening, witness the enormous population of free-tailed bats, some two million strong, swarm from Lang Cave. &#xA0;This is one of the last places to encounter the nomadic Penan people.&#xA0; Now only about 200 out of some 16,000 Penans cling to the traditional way of life.&#xA0; They are noted for their practice of &#x2018;molong,&#x2019; never taking more than necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Penang: &lt;/strong&gt;Penang is the second smallest state in Malaysia, and sits on the northwest coast of Peninsular Malaysia by the Strait of Malacca.&#xA0; It is estimated that the area was inhabited as far back as 5,000 years.&#xA0; Penang was part of the Malay Sultanate of Kedah, but in 1786, the sultan handed control over to the British East India Company in exchange for promised military protection from invading armies from Siam and Burma.&#xA0; In 1826, Penang, Malacca and Singapore became part of the Straits Settlements, under direct British colonial rule in 1867.&#xA0; In 1948, Penang became part of the Federation of Malaya, which nine years later gained independence. &#xA0;The capital of George Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for its unique architecture and culture that includes rows of century-old &#x201C;shophouses&#x201D; and colonial villas.&#xA0; Local artisans still practice the traditional Chinese art called Khoo Kongsi, delicately carved wooden panels.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Singapore: &lt;/strong&gt;Red coiled incense smolders just outside ancient temples, brilliantly colored birds sing from birdcages along the street, monks in morning prayer blend together to form the mosaic that is Singapore.&#xA0; On the major sea routes at the tip of the Malay Peninsula, the island-city-state has been visited by Chinese junks, Indian vessels, Arab dhows, and Portuguese and English battleships.&#xA0; Singapore reflects that dynamic mix in its sleek skyscrapers, tropical gardens and pockets of traditional neighborhoods.&#xA0; Little India is packed with pungent spices in stalls along Arab Street and colorful Sri Mariammam Temple is boldly adorned with gods, demons, mortals and animals. &#xA0;Chinatown has a plethora of shops of crafts, clothes, teas and potions. &#xA0;Fine hotels and restaurants, a busy nightlife and nearby Sentosa Island&#x2019;s relaxed resorts make this a great way to begin or end an Asian odyssey.&#xD;

	&lt;li&gt;This region can be enjoyed year around as it is generally hot, sunny and fairly uniform.&#xA0; It usually rains for a bit every day with more rain during the monsoons.&#xA0; Southwest Monsoon is from late May to September, and Northeast Monsoon from November to March.&#xA0; In Borneo, travel is possible year round, but the best season is March-October, during the dry season, although it still rains in the forest.&#xA0; This is also the best time for diving.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Lunar New Year comes in January or February and is the highlight of the Chinese calendar. &#xA0;It is celebrated throughout Southeast Asia.&#xA0; The festival lasts for 15 days and includes the famous Dragon dance and parades all along the streets. &#xA0;The atmosphere in Singapore&#x2019;s Chinatown is a visual treat with fireworks and more.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Moon Cake Festival, a mid-autumn festival (Chung Chiu), is the third major festival of the Chinese calendar, and is celebrated on the 15th day of the eighth month in Singapore and Malaysia.&#xA0; It corresponds to the harvest festival observed by Western cultures (in Hong Kong, it is held in conjunction with the annual Lantern Festival).&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Sarawak Extravaganza, in August, is a month-long celebration in Kuching, featuing&#xA0;arts and crafts, street parades, food fairs and traditional games - all celebrating the culture of Sarawak.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Thailand&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Bangkok:&lt;/strong&gt; Bangkok has been Thailand&#x2019;s capital since 1782. It began as a small trading post at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River in the mid-14th century. Today it is a global city that blends Thai, Chinese, Indian, Buddhist, Muslim and Western cultures. Its most notable landmark is the brilliant Grand Palace, with gilded spires, elaborate halls, pavilions and murals. The chapel of the Emerald Buddha adjoins the palace. Its superb 31-inch-high Emerald Buddha, carved from a single block of jade, is one of Thailand&#x2019;s most revered icons. Temples such as the reclining Buddha and Wat Trimitir dot the cityscape. The city is home to the Damnoen Saduak Floating Market.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Chiang Mai:&lt;/strong&gt; Chiang Mai is the largest city in the north, with more than 300 Buddhist temples, 20 churches and 13 mosques.&#xA0; A long-standing ritual takes place before sunrise each day when residents present food offerings to monks who gather for a procession through the town.&#xA0; Founded in 1296, the city was a strategically important center on an ancient trade route. &#xA0;It was built to succeed Chiang Rai as the capital of the Lanna Kingdom.&#xA0; The city, however, was abandoned between 1776 and 1791. &#xA0;Today, Chiang Mai is a dynamic and modern city, which works to weave the rich tapestry of history with its increasingly modern side.&#xA0; Close by are the celebrated mountain hill tribes and artisan villages such as the traditional Akha people, known for sumptuous costumes with elaborate silver-embellished headdresses; and the Yao who are recognized for their customarily colorful embroidered outfits.&#xA0; The notorious Golden Triangle here borders on Thailand, Burma, and Laos.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Chiang Rai:&lt;/strong&gt; Chiang Rai was founded in 1262 and became the capital of the Mangrai dynasty, but soon lost its status to the new city of Chiang Mai. Chiang Rai was conquered by then-Burma and remained under its control for several hundred years. In 1432, the small Emerald Buddha, Thailand&#x2019;s most revered Buddha statue, was discovered when an earthquake or lightening, depending on the storyteller, cracked open the stupa at Wat Phra Kaeo revealing the small jade figurine. The city is a good base for exploring the area&#x2019;s vintage temples, local museums, lush forests and waterfalls. The Karen people are noted for their woven attire and profusion of beaded jewelry.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Hua Hin:&lt;/strong&gt; Thailand&#x2019;s oldest resort, Hua Hin has been a beachside resort town for more than 70 years and lures both foreign and Thai visitors.&#xA0; King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) visited this humble fishing village in the early 1920s, and thought it would be an ideal escape from Bangkok&#x2019;s steamy summers. &#xA0;In 1928, the king built a summer palace here, which remains one of the royal residences.&#xA0; Siam&#x2019;s upper class and nobility followed, building summer homes along the beachfront.&#xA0; A railway line from Bangkok insured the area&#x2019;s easy access for nearly everyone. &#xA0;In addition to water sports, golf and spas, the area features great parks, serene waterfalls and mysterious caves. &#xA0;Hua Hin has the ideal recipe for a relaxing stay in an exotic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Lampang &amp;amp; Sukhothai:&lt;/strong&gt; Lampang is a pastoral town with well-preserved temples.&#xA0; It was the center of the ninth-century Hariphunchai Kingdom, and its goldtopped temple is one of the most sacred in northern Thailand.&#xA0; Si Satchanalai was a thriving spiritual center from the 13th to 15th centuries. &#xA0;Its grandeur is evident in the remnants of its temples with their detailed carvings of floral designs and poetic human figures.&#xA0; In the 12th century, Sukhothai was capital of the first independent Thai Kingdom.&#xA0; The dynasty flourished for more than 150 years, and its legacy lingers in the more than 20 remaining shrines.&#xA0; Nearby is a training camp for young elephants, where visitors learn about the lifelong relationships between elephants and their handlers.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Khao Sok National Park:&lt;/strong&gt; In Surat Thani Province, the park comprises the largest area of virgin forest in Southern Thailand, and is a remnant of rainforest which is older and more diverse than the Amazon rainforest. The park is home to Malayan tapir, Asian elephant, tiger, Sambar deer, bear, guar, wild boar and white-handed gibbon. Langurs are one of the most common monkeys seen here, especially at the Cheow Larn Lake in the center of the park.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Phuket, Krabi &amp;amp; Phi Phi Islands:&lt;/strong&gt; Phuket, Thailand&#x2019;s largest island, has been dubbed Pearl of the Andaman for its golden beaches and turquoise waters.&#xA0; Its historic towns are steeped in Thai, Chinese and Malay culture.&#xA0; The rocky limestone cliffs, powdery beaches, tranquil bays and forests make this a wealthy and popular island with world-class resorts.&#xA0; Seafood lovers can enjoy the island&#x2019;s famous lobster. &#xA0;Krabi is a southern province on the Andaman coast. &#xA0;It may be the country&#x2019;s oldest continually inhabited human settlement. Stone tools, ancient beads, pottery and skeletal remains have been discovered in the surrounding cliffs and caves. &#xA0;Krabi may have been home to Homo sapiens back to 35,000-25,000 BC.&#xA0; The province includes several coralfringed islands with well-known dive sites. &#xA0;The largest, Ko Lanta Yai, is park headquarters and home to the Chao Le, sea gypsies who subsist on fishing.&#xA0; Phi Phi Islands sit between Phuket and Thailand&#x2019;s coast along the Andaman Sea, and feature limestone cliffs, splendid beaches, and caves such as Viking Cave with natural formations and rock paintings.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Nakorn Ratchasima, Khao Yai, Amphawa &amp;amp; Ayutthaya:&lt;/strong&gt; Commonly called Korat, Nakorn Ratchisima was important to the Khmer kingdom. Nearby Prasat Hin Phimai National Historical Park shows that this area was connected to distant Angkor Wat in Cambodia by a &#x2018;royal&#x2019; road dating from the end of the 11th century. &#xA0;This is Thailand&#x2019;s largest collection of Khmer buildings.&#xA0; Khao Yai National Park was Thailand&#x2019;s first national park, and some 3,000 species of plants have been identified.&#xA0; Wildlife includes wild elephant, deer, bat, monkey, wild dog, marbled cat, leopard, gaur, dusky langur and the very rare tiger and Malayan sun bear, and more than 180 bird species.&#xA0; Khao Yai has a variety of activities including jungle treks, bird watching, canoeing and elephant trekking excursions. &#xA0;Amphawa District is steeped in history and its waterways allow boats to travel to once-hidden temples and visit traditional wooden homes.&#xA0; Amphawa Floating Market, unlike some more visited bazaars, remains an authentic market, and may be the best kept secret in Thailand. &#xA0;The UNESCO World Heritage Site of Ayutthaya was a thriving Siamese kingdom from 1350 until 1767, when it was captured by the Burmese. Today, Ayutthaya is known for its spectacular ruins and temples, including Wat Chai Mongkol with its Reclining Buddha.&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;h4&gt;Best Time to Travel to Thailand&#xD;
Festivals &amp;amp; Special Events&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The rainy season generally runs May to October.&#xA0; Best travel times are November to March. April to June can be very hot.&#xA0; In Bangkok, April is harshly hot. October&#x2019;s heavy rains may cause flooding.&#xA0; December to March is best for beaches.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Songkran Festival is usually in mid-April.&#xA0; As in other Asian nations, this New Year celebration is also called Water Festival.&#xA0; It lasts three to ten days, depending on region.&#xA0; A spring cleaning day supports a belief that old and useless items must be thrown away or bad luck will come.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Loy Krathong takes place on the full moon in November. &#xA0;During the evening, for good luck, many people go to their local river to float a krathong, which contains a flower, a candle and three burning incense sticks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;In February, the Flower Festival is held in Chiang Mai. Amazing floral displays and local handicrafts are sold and there are beauty pageants.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Wax Castle Festival in October is at the end of Buddhist Lent. People in northeast Thailand mark the occasion by creating miniature beeswax Buddhist temples and shrines. &#xA0;These "wax castles" earn the makers merit. Sakon Nakhon celebrates with a grand wax procession, boat races and traditional cultural performances.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Vietnam&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Dalat:&lt;/strong&gt; At an elevation of just under 1,500 meters/4,929 feet, this is Vietnam&#x2019;s premier hill station with winding streets, scenic churches, vegetable gardens and waterfalls. &#xA0;In the South Central Highlands, this was originally the playground of the French who built mountain villas to escape the heat of the coast.&#xA0; Dalat has some of the best mountain biking, hiking and canyoning opportunities in Vietnam as well as coffee and tea plantations.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Halong Bay:&lt;/strong&gt; Halong Bay is famed for its quiet beauty. Thousands of islands and islets inhabit the bay, adjacent to the Gulf of Tonkin. Monolithic limestone islands jut skyward topped with dense jungle, looking like skullcaps. Many islands have cave systems such as Hang Dau Go, with its huge, three chambered cave reached via 90 steps. The cave was used in the 13th century to store bamboo stakes used against Mongol invading armies. An overnight journey aboard a Chinese-style junk offers the perfect way to experience this exquisite setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Hanoi:&lt;/strong&gt; Hanoi has served as a capital city for more than a thousand years, through wars, invasions and name changes, yet it still has the feel of youth with all the energy of a teenager.&#xA0; Perhaps part of that impression comes from the hoards of motor scooters that jam the streets every day: young women in heels on their way to work, parents with children piled on, and young men balancing impossibly cumbersome loads on their scooters.&#xA0; The Old Quarter&#x2019;s chaotic hodgepodge of skinny lanes contrasts with the French Quarter&#x2019;s wide, tree-lined boulevards. &#xA0;Founded in 1070, the Temple of Literature became Hanoi&#x2019;s first university.&#xA0; A visit to the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum is an intriguing cultural experience.&#xA0; Beginning early in the morning, a few Westerners intermingle with the hundreds of Vietnamese uniformed school girls, old men in caps and young soldiers in lines that snake down the street.&#xA0; Quietly, they file past the glassencased body of their former leader.&#xA0; Nearby are two houses he lived in until his death in 1969.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Ho Chi Minh City &amp;amp; Cu Chi Tunnels:&lt;/strong&gt; Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, is Vietnam&#x2019;s largest city.&#xA0; More than 300 years of history and tradition thrive in pockets amid the markets, sleek bars, sidewalk caf&#xE9;s and office buildings. Cholon, &#x201C;Big Market,&#x201D; a separate China town in the 18th century, is a jumble of shops, offices and houses packed into one neighborhood.&#xA0; Notre Dame Cathedral, built between 1877 and 1883, sits in the heart of the government quarter.&#xA0; The French-style Central Post, 1886, is the country&#x2019;s largest.&#xA0; The Reunification Palace and War Remnants Museum stand witness to troubled times.&#xA0; Jade Emperor Pagoda was a meeting place for Chinese secret societies. Ben Thanh is the city&#x2019;s central market.&#xA0; Giac Lam Pagoda is city&#x2019;s oldest.&#xA0; Some 40 kilometers/25 miles from the city, Cu Chi Tunnels, is a complex of underground tunnels dug during the French occupation in the 1940s, and further expanded in the 1960s during the war with the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Hoi An:&lt;/strong&gt; Hoi An is a delight for shoppers.&#xA0; Rows of shops sell souvenirs, trinkets, silk pashminas, colorful prints of street scenes and more. &#xA0;It is famous for its tailors, who produce fine made-to-measure clothes virtually overnight, and for a fraction of the cost of upscale ready-made western clothing. Internet caf&#xE9;s, bars and restaurants have opened along the riverfront.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Hue:&lt;/strong&gt; Hue&#x2019;s Old Imperial City is another UNESCO World Heritage Site. &#xA0;The Forbidden Purple City was built early in the 19th century, modeled after the much larger original in Beijing.&#xA0; The central passageway, with its yellow doors, and the bridge across the lotus pond were for the exclusive use of the emperor. &#xA0;Thai Hoa Palace, built in 1803, has a spacious hall with an ornate roof of huge timbers supported by 80 carved, lacquered columns.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Mai Chau &amp;amp; Sa Pa:&lt;/strong&gt; Mai Chau is the closest authentic Montagnard village to Hanoi where most of the people are ethnic White Tai, distantly related to tribes in Thailand, Laos and China. &#xA0;White Thai are also found in Po, Coong, Lac Village and Van Mai. &#xA0;The Hmong live in the villages of Xa Linh and Pa Co. Ba Vi National Park is on Mount Ba Vi, an isolated mountain west of Hanoi. &#xA0;The forest includes lowland evergreen forest, coniferous and broadleaf forest.&#xA0; Sa Pa is known for its steeply terraced rice fields, verdant ridgelines, mud thatched villages, raging rivers and astounding waterfalls. &#xA0;The French-built hill station is high in the Tonkinese Alps near the Chinese border.&#xA0; Villagers in the area don colorful costumes for market day on Saturday.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Mekong Delta &amp;amp; Can Tho:&lt;/strong&gt; The delta is characterized by a labyrinth of waterways and channels.&#xA0; The Vietnamese cultivate the fertile agricultural lands of the Mekong River&#x2019;s delta and produce about half of Vietnam&#x2019;s total agricultural output.&#xA0; The inhabitants are largely ethnic Viet, with Khmer minorities and a large group of Hoa (ethnic Chinese).&#xA0; Some of the delta islands are home to villagers who create traditional handcrafts, harvest honey on bee farms and produce sweet coconut candy.&#xA0; Markets, stores, ship yards, and repair shops also thrive along river banks and in the delta.&#xA0; Can Tho is the delta&#x2019;s biggest city and is noted for its floating market.&#xA0; The region has recently been dubbed a &#x2018;biological treasure trove&#x2019; for the more than 1,000 new species of plants that have been found in newly explored areas.&#xA0; The Mekong is the longest river in Southeast Asia, flowing 4,184 kilometers/2,600 miles from inland China southeast through Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam before emptying into the South China Sea.&#xA0; The Mekong is the lifeblood of the region for millions of villagers dependent on the river as a source of economic livelihood and food.&#xA0; Cruises travel between Vietnam and Cambodia, taking in floating markets selling fish, tropical fruit, vegetables and flowers; and scenes of rural life that are repeated daily as they have been for centuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Nha Trang:&lt;/strong&gt; Nha Trang is a favorite vacation spot for well-heeled Vietnamese. &#xA0;A wide palm-lined boulevard separates elegant Mediterranean-style villas and modern hotels from one of Vietnam&#x2019;s loveliest beaches. &#xA0;The Oceanographic Institute was founded in 1923, and has an aquarium that includes seahorses.&#xA0; A seawater aquarium on Mieu Island is an important fish breeding farm where over 40 species of fish are raised.&#xA0; Lang Son Pagoda was founded in the late 19th century.&#xA0; A huge white Buddha on a lotus blossom sits on the hill behind the pagoda. &#xA0;At Po Nagar Cham Towers, Hindus have worshipped since the second century AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;h4&gt;Best Time to Travel to Vietnam&#xD;
Festivals and Special Events&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;There are three seasons &#x2013; hot, rainy and cold. Vietnam can be a year-round destination depending on itinerary. The country is long and crosses various weather regions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The Mekong Delta in the south is hot, humid and tropical all year, but rains the most from&#xA0;May to November.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The north is pleasant during March and April and October into December, but can be really cold in summer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;T&#x1EBF;t, Lunar New Year, is the most important festival in Vietnam.&#xA0; It falls between late January and early February, depending on the lunar calendar.&#xA0; It is a time for family reunions, for paying respect to ancestors and elders. &#xA0;Although a national holiday, each region and religion has its own customs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Tet Trung Thu, Mid-Autumn Festival, is one of the most popular yearly family holidays.&#xA0; It is held on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month, the time of the year when the moon is thought to be at its brightest and roundest, indicating a time of harmony and plenitude.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Suggested Vietnam Tour Itinerary&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Hanoi, Vietnam&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Hanoi is an intriguing blend of East and West &#x2013; Chinese influence mixes with its French colonial past.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Hanoi&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Argentina Travel&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Buenos Aires:&lt;/strong&gt; Like most thriving metropolises, the city has something for everyone in its landscaped parks and gardens, sports stadiums, restaurants, racing, golf courses and theaters. But Buenos Aires has one thing no other city has &#x2013; the tango! Romantic, vigorous, and passionate, the tango is a product of the city where it was born. For those who fancy a turn on the dance floor, professional tango instructors offer lessons, and tango shows can be found in night clubs and at dinner shows. The city is a joy for shoppers with areas such as Florida Street, San Martin Plaza and in San Telmo, where antiques abound. The Italian Boca district, Palermo Park, and Recoleta Cemetery add to the city&#x2019;s charm. The city also boasts the highest concentration of theaters in the world in addition to museums, galleries and hundreds of bookstores.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Glaciers National Park &amp;amp; El Calafate:&lt;/strong&gt; In 1927, El Calafate was designed as a site to shelter for wool traders, and also with the hope that the fledgling town would attract settlers. Today, the Patagonian village is an ideal base to explore Los Glaciares National Park, including the Perito Moreno Glacier. Patagonia has a splendid menu of outdoor activities: bird watching, hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Iguassu Falls:&lt;/strong&gt; &#x2018;Big Water,&#x2019; is a massive waterfall that borders Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. &#xA0;Multihued mist rises above the falls, and luxuriant flowers, ferns, tropical plants, butterflies and exotic birds thrive.&#xA0; From the Argentine side, visitors can see some 275 cascades tumbling into Devil&#x2019;s Gorge. &#xA0;The Rainforest Ecological Train ride ends at the gorge.&#xA0; Walkways and overlooks reward visitors with incredible views.&#xA0; The border between Brazil and Argentina runs through the Devil&#x2019;s Throat, with the majority on the Argentinian side.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Mendoza:&lt;/strong&gt; Founded in 1561, Mendoza is brimming with history.&#xA0; A major road between Argentina and Chile runs through Mendoza, making it a frequent stop for climbers on their way to scale Mt. Aconcagua (highest mountain in the Western Hemisphere). &#xA0;Mendoza enjoys an outdoor attitude with its proximity to the Andes. &#xA0;It is popular for sport enthusiasts interested in mountaineering, hiking, horseback riding, rafting, and, in winter, snow skiing. Two of the main industries are wine making and olive oil production. Argentina&#x2019;s wine-making traditions date back to the 16th century when a Chilean friar planted the first cuttings.&#xA0; Vineyards here thrive at some of the highest altitudes in the world, up to 1,100 meters/3,610 feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Pampas:&lt;/strong&gt; The great plains in the heartland recall the romance and daring of the Wild West.&#xA0; Gauchos, Argentine cowboys, still work on traditional cattle ranches, estancias, in the Pampas.&#xA0; Some of these historic estancias have added luxurious accommodations for visitors.&#xA0; Guests witness the gauchos in action on horseback.&#xA0; The fit and adventurous can even opt to join a cattle drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Salta &amp;amp; The Northwest:&lt;/strong&gt; Salta, founded in 1582, claims some of the nation&#x2019;s best-preserved colonial architecture. &#xA0;An ancient Inca road leads into the Humhuaca Gorge, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&#xA0; Its hillsides are cast in horizontal bands of color &#x2013; rust, yellow, and green for the minerals in the soil. The area is a repository of Indian culture, history, music, religion and art that can be glimpsed in Tilcara&#x2019;s archaeological museum and at an old Indian fortress.&#xA0; From November to March, Salta&#x2019;s countryside warrants a side trip to its scenic villages, vineyards, and the rugged canyons of Cafayate. &#xA0;From April to October, the &#x201C;Train to the Clouds&#x201D; travels a thrilling zigzag route through mountain passes up to 3,810 meters/12,500 feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;San Carlos de Bariloche:&lt;/strong&gt; Often referred to simply as Bariloche, it rests on the shores of Nahuel Huapi Lake, with the Patagonian Steppe to the east and the rugged Andes to the west. &#xA0;In the Lake District, Cerro Catedral is one of the best ski centers in South America.&#xA0; From this luxurious landscape, a satisfying menu of adventures includes skiing, fishing, nature hikes, mountain climbing and boating.&#xA0;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Tierra del Fuego National Park:&lt;/strong&gt; Ushuaia is the world&#x2019;s southernmost city, and is set on the banks of the Beagle Channel. &#xA0;The &#x201C;Train at the End of the World&#x201D; chugs through remote forests and snowy peaks to reach the dramatic Tierra del Fuego. &#xA0;A short cruise along Beagle Channel visits the bird-rich Lobos Island.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Yacutinga Reserve:&lt;/strong&gt; Sights and sounds of the jungle add to the experience of the primitive interior in the Iguassu National Park. &#xA0;Reached only by boat on the Iguassu River, Yacutinga Lodge &amp;amp; Wildlife Nature Reserve sits in the northernmost area of Misiones, a place of wide rivers, reddish clay soil and subtropical weather.&#xA0; Specialized park rangers guide excursions while a resident biologist presents lectures about the fascinating world of the park.&#xD;

&lt;h4&gt;Best Times to Travel to Argentina&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;Festivals and Special Events&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Seasons are the reverse of those in the Northern Hemisphere.&#xA0; Buenos Aires is ideal in fall, March &#x2013; May; and spring is September - November, when temperatures are mild.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Plan a trip to Patagonia and the southern Andes in summer, December - March, when days are longer and warmer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;June&#xA0;- August is winter and the best time for&#xA0;the Northwest.&#xA0; Rain and heat subside.&#xA0; During spring, August &#x2013; October, the Northwest has pleasant temperatures yet fewer crowds.&#xA0; This is also an ideal time to visit Iguassu Falls as the spring colors are at their&#xA0;brightest.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Towards the end of February, the Fiesta Nacional de la Vendimia in Mendoza lasts a week, and celebrates the grape harvest.&#xA0; It is a great time to sample Mendoza's finest wines.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Argentina is polo country between March and May, and September through December.&#xA0; It hosts the world's biggest polo event, the Argentine Open Polo Championships, usually in late November at the polo grounds in Palermo, near Las Ca&#xF1;itas neighborhood of Buenos Aires.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Brasilia:&lt;/strong&gt; The national capital was developed in 1956; however, it had been envisioned nearly a century earlier. &#xA0;The plan was originally conceived in 1827 when Brazil was under colonial rule, but not acted on for more than a century.&#xA0; An article in the constitution of 1891 stated that the capital should be moved to a place close to the center of the country.&#xA0; This is the only city built in the 20th century designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for the grand architecture of its public buildings, gardens and avenues.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Buzios:&lt;/strong&gt; Buzios boasts 20 superb beaches with crystal-clear water, quiet coves and relaxing beaches.&#xA0; Settled by European pirates and slave traders, Buzios evolved into a town of rustic charm with stylish shops and restaurants. It retains the ambiance of a small village.&#xA0; Fishing, scuba diving, windsurfing, snorkeling and other water sports are available.&#xA0; To preserve the environment, an area around the village is now Ubajara and Jericoacoara National Park.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Iguassu Falls:&lt;/strong&gt; Both the Brazilian and Argentinean sides of this magnificent horseshoe-shaped falls are designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&#xA0; On the right bank, the Brazilian territory has just over 20% of falls, and Argentina has 80% of the falls on the Brazilian side, there is a walkway along the canyon with an extension to the lower base of the Devil&#x2019;s Throat.&#xA0; Brazilian transport system has been restyled to allow more visitors, while reducing environmental impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Manaus &amp;amp; Amazon Rainforest:&lt;/strong&gt; Manaus is the largest metropolitan area in Northern Brazil. &#xA0;At the start of the century, it was known as Heart of the Amazon and City of the Forest.&#xA0; The Amazon River basin spreads across nine nations, but 60 percent is in Brazil. &#xA0;It makes up over half of the planet&#x2019;s rainforests, and is the most species-rich tropical forest in the world.&#xA0; At least 40,000 plant species, 3,000 fish, 1,294 birds, 427 mammals and 378 reptiles have been reported.&#xA0; One in five birds on earth lives here.&#xA0; This is also the last refuge of Brazil&#x2019;s indigenous tribes. &#xA0;Eco-lodges offer comfortable settings to discover this incredible habitat. &#xA0;A boat trip, &#x201C;Meeting of the Waters,&#x201D; is a captivating journey to see the black waters of Negro River and the brown waters of Solim&#xF5;es River run together for miles without mixing before becoming the Amazon River.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Natal:&lt;/strong&gt; Natal is known for its giant white sand dunes.&#xA0; Its Dunas Park is the second largest urban park in Brazil.&#xA0; It has important museums such as Museu de Arte Sacra, and Museu de Cultura Popular. &#xA0;Forte dos Reis Magos is a medieval, fortress from 1598. Natal embraces 150 colonial, art-deco, neoclassical and modernist buildings.&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Praia do Forte:&lt;/strong&gt; This beach and a coastal village has a protected environmental area with about 12 kilometers/7.5 miles of semi-deserted beach bordered by lush groves of coconut palms.&#xA0; The turtle sanctuary here is one of 22 bases along the Brazilian coast, which have released millions of turtle hatchlings into the Atlantic. &#xA0;This is a good spot to view humpback whales.&#xA0; Nearby are the charming Fishermen&#x2019;s Village and Garcia D&#x2019;Avila Castle, the first great Portuguese structure in Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Recife &amp;amp; Olinda:&lt;/strong&gt; Recife is famous for its 17th-century architecture.&#xA0; History buffs love these towns for their old quarters, ornate churches and an Inquisition jail. &#xA0;Olinda, a UNESCO World Heritage City, is nearly 500 years old.&#xA0; The Dutch occupied it for 24 years, adding to the cultural mix of Indian, African and Portuguese.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Rio de Janeiro:&lt;/strong&gt; Rio is the most visited city in the southern hemisphere. From Copacabana Beach to Sugarloaf Mountain, it makes a grand impression. Other landmarks include the 36-meter/120-foot statue of Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado Mountain; a small-scale model of Paris Opera; the National Library with an edition of the rare Gutenberg Bible and Maracan&#xE3; Stadium, one of the world&#x2019;s largest football stadiums.&#xA0; Tijuca National Forest is the largest urban forest in the world.&#xA0; French architectural influence is visible in Marechal Floriano Square.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Salvador:&lt;/strong&gt; This is called the soul of Brazil as it was here the nation was founded in the 17th century.&#xA0; The historic slave auction site contrasts markedly with the baroque S&#xE3;o Francisco Church and Convent.&#xA0; Salvador is noted for its cuisine, music and Portuguese architecture.&#xA0; The old city center is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;S&#xE3;o Paulo:&lt;/strong&gt; Founded in 1532, this is a city on the move.&#xA0; It is the largest city in Brazil and largest in the southern hemisphere.&#xA0; As such, it wields significant cultural, economic and political influence. &#xA0;The city is also known for its architecture, gastronomy and cultural venues. &#xA0;It hosts high profile events such as the Brazil Grand Prix, Fashion Week, ATP Brazil Open, and the S&#xE3;o Paulo Indy 300.&#xD;

&lt;h4&gt;Best Times to Travel to Brazil&#xD;
Festivals &amp;amp; Special Events&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Larger than the United States, Brazil has five major climatic subtypes:&#xA0; equatorial, tropical, semiarid, highland tropical, and temperate. &#xA0;In general, winter lasts from June to August, with the coldest temperatures south of Rio.&#xA0; Summer runs December to March with stifling humidity in the far south.&#xA0; Brief rains are common, given the tropical climate, but the dry interior has fewer months of heavy rainfall.&#xA0; The Amazon Basin is the wettest area, and near the mouth of the river it rains year round. &#xA0;The heaviest rainfall is from December to May.&#xA0; In the area of Recife, the wettest time is May to August.&#xA0; Further south in Rio, the wet season is November to April. From July to December, it is possible to drive the Pantanal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Carnaval is a four-day celebration throughout much of the continent. But no city is more identified with Carnaval than Rio.&#xA0; From Saturday to Fat Tuesday, in keeping with the Catholic season of Lent, Rio is an unforgettable party of masked balls, parades with outrageously costumed revelers and fireworks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The June Bonfire Festivals are an integral part of Brazilian culture.&#xA0; Throughout Rio, folklore celebrations take place in the form of games, dancing, fireworks and bonfires.&#xA0; Children and many adults dress country-style for the festivities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Reveillon, New Year's Eve in Rio is an extravaganza when millions pack the beaches for an all-night festival of music, food and fireworks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Easter Island:&lt;/strong&gt; Few places have gripped the world&#x2019;s imagination more than Easter Island with its giant stone figures. &#xA0;Some 600 giant stone moai figures dot the island.&#xA0; This lonely speck of land is about 3,701 kilometers/2,300 miles west of Santiago in the Pacific Ocean.&#xA0; A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Rapa Nui National Park, includes Ahu Vinapu&#x2019;s Inca-like precise stonework; Rano Raraku quarry where the giant figures were carved; and Rano Kao with it curious ruins of the village of Orongo, a likely center for the ancient birdman cult. &#xA0;Other areas to explore include historic Ana Tepahu caverns; Puna Pao quarry, source of the giant red cylinders crowning many of the statues; Rano Raraku Volcano; and the toppled moai of Akahanga.&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Isla Negra, Valparaiso &amp;amp; Vi&#xF1;a del Mar:&lt;/strong&gt; Isla Negra is a tranquil family seaside resort, and is known as the home of the late Nobel poet Pablo Neruda. His eccentrically designed house is now a museum.&#xA0; For 500 years, Valparaiso has been a port of call for vessels from around the world.&#xA0; This colorful city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. &#xA0;From conquistadors and pirates to Charles Darwin and James Whistler, all came in search of some form of treasure. &#xA0;It is Chile&#x2019;s principal port and secondlargest city.&#xA0; Its hilltop suburbs are reached by funicular railways and stairway footpaths.&#xA0; Vi&#xF1;a del Mar is called the Garden City for its many parks and garden.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Northern Chile:&lt;/strong&gt; This fascinating region is well off the tourist&#x2019;s beat.&#xA0; Small towns and villages such as Rio Hurtado and Pisco Elqui are set in the Andes amid striking mountain landscapes.&#xA0; The Altiplano is Chile&#x2019;s link with the great civilizations of the Central Andes. &#xA0;Even now, the traditional, nomadic society of Aymara wanders the Altiplano with their llamas and alpacas. &#xA0;Experienced riders can venture out to &#x201C;the roof of the Andes,&#x201D; at heights up to 3,800 meters/12,467 feet. Nature hikes, a visit to an unusual winery and ancient petroglyphs, some dating back 4,000 years, make this an intriguing area. Rock carvings depict masked faces, animals and other images. &#xA0;Caves show some of the earliest traces of human settlement here.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Patagonia:&lt;/strong&gt; This vast region at the southernmost tip of South America is shared by Argentina and Chile. &#xA0;Civilizations with mystical rites, sailors and pioneers have added to its history.&#xA0; Torres del Paine National Park covers 242,002 hectares/598,000 acres with granite peaks, glaciers, lakes and waterfalls. &#xA0;A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Torres del Paine is the focus of the park. Bernardo O&#x2019;Higgins National Park borders it to the west, while Los Glaciares National Park is just north in Argentina.&#xA0; The scenery is dominated by the Paine massif. &#xA0;Small valleys separate mighty granite spires and mountains of the massif. &#xA0;Outdoor pursuits include climbing, fly fishing, sailing, horseback riding, kayaking and trekking.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Patagonia Cruises:&lt;/strong&gt; Cruises travel through the Southern Patagonia Ice Field and navigate channels, past fjords and glaciers.&#xA0; Many legendary explorers walked these ice fields including Ladrillero, Darwin and Fitz Roy.&#xA0; Ships sail through Montanas Fjord, past colossal mountains.&#xA0; Trekkers explore the dense forest on the way to Bernal Glacier.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Pucon &amp;amp; Villarica:&lt;/strong&gt; Pucon is a small city in the middle of the southern lake region. &#xA0;The Andes here change into a series of spectacular volcanoes, age-old forests and lakes of distinctive beauty. &#xA0;This is a fashionable resort area with abundant activities such as trekking, glacier treks, boating and mountain biking. &#xA0;Snow-covered Villarica, one of Chile&#x2019;s most active volcanoes, is one of only four volcanoes in the world known to have an active lava lake within its crater.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Puerto Varas &amp;amp; Chiloe Island:&lt;/strong&gt; In southern Chile, Puerto Varas is known for its strong German flavor as a result of German immigration in the mid-19th century.&#xA0; Llanquihue Lake is one of the largest natural lakes in South America; and Osorno Volcano is one of the most historically active volcanoes of the southern Chilean Andes.&#xA0; It sits on a 250,000-year-old eroded stratovolcano, with a caldera that is six kilometers/3.7 miles wide.&#xA0; Mt. Osorno has a year round chairlift for skiing in winter and sightseeing in summer.&#xA0; Chiloe is the largest island of the Chiloe Archipelago. &#xA0;Having evolved for centuries isolated from mainland, the &#x201C;Chilotes&#x201D; developed a strong, selfreliant culture, rich in folklore. &#xA0;Chiloe has crafts markets, museums, great seafood and a unique architectural heritage. &#xA0;Visitors to the island include blue whale, dolphin, sea lion, marine otter and Humboldt penguin.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Santiago &amp;amp; Winelands:&lt;/strong&gt; Santiago is one of Latin America&#x2019;s most modern metropolitan areas.&#xA0; It boasts some of Latin America&#x2019;s most modern transportation infrastructure, including a metro system.&#xA0; Set in a valley with a mild Mediterranean climate, the city&#x2019;s charm is found in its old quarter, Spanish colonial churches, Europeanstyle districts, gardens and government palaces. Chile&#x2019;s famous wine estates are nearby. This region is the center of a wine-growing tradition dating back to the mid-16th century.&#xA0; Many historic wine estates remain family-run, and several wine estates have accommodations and guest facilities.&#xD;

&lt;h4&gt;Best Time to Travel to Chile&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;Festivals and Special Events&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The warm summer months, December to February, are popular times to visit southern Chile.&#xA0; Winds are also strongest during these months.&#xA0; In winter, May to September, travel is limited as most trails are closed and waterways frozen.&#xA0; Ski season in central Chile usually begins in June.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Shoulder seasons, October and November and March and April, typically have slightly lower temperatures, less wind and fewer travelers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Northern Chile&#x2019;s Atacama Desert and distant Easter Island are year-round destinations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Festival del Huaso de Olmu&#xE9;, is an annual folk music festival that comes at the end of January, while the five-day Festival of Song, in February, in Vina del Mar, draws musicians and entertainers from around Latin America.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Semana Santa (Easter week) is much celebrated in Chile, which is predominately Catholic.&#xA0; Starting with Good Friday, every town holds religious ceremonies, parades and other events.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Bogota:&lt;/strong&gt; Colombia&#x2019;s capital city sits at an elevation of 2,640 meters/8,660 feet in the Andino region.&#xA0; Century-old plazas and churches coexist with towering skyscrapers and peaceful tree-lined bicycle paths. &#xA0;Bogota is a modern and metropolitan city, home to universities and regional offices for multinational companies. &#xA0;The historic center is known as La Candelaria. &#xA0;The Gold Museum boasts an astonishing collection of pre-Colombian treasures. The northern section of the city combines upscale living with affluent shopping centers, boutiques and restaurants.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Cartagena:&lt;/strong&gt; Cartagena was a major trading port for gold and silver going to Spain.&#xA0; It also had an active slave market.&#xA0; The old city features Spanish colonial architecture as well as Italian and republican styles. &#xA0;Highlights include the 16thcentury Cathedral of Cartagena, San Pedro Claver Square and the Museum of Modern Art.&#xA0; The 18thcentury Palace of the Inquisition is an eerie reminder of a turbulent period in world history.&#xA0; Built between 1639 and 1657, the Spanish-built Castillo de San Felipe de Barajas includes a network of underground tunnels constructed so that it was possible to hear the footsteps of an approaching enemy. &#xA0;Augustinian Fathers Convent is now the University of Cartagena. &#xA0;The Heredia Theater is an architectural gem fronting the Plaza de la Merced.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Coffee Zone:&lt;/strong&gt; The cities of Armenia and Pereira stand in the center of the western region of the country in a small valley that descends from a part of the Andes. &#xA0;This is the heart of the coffee zone and of the Colombian culture. Touring coffee plantations allows visitors to see the complete process of growing and production &#x2013; from planting seeds to sampling a cup of Colombia&#x2019;s finest coffee.&#xA0; The Valley of Cocora is a wildlife sanctuary in the central Andean mountains and principal location of the national tree, the Quind&#xED;o wax palm. &#xA0;Activities include hiking, bird watching, fishing, mountain biking and rafting.&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Medellin:&lt;/strong&gt; During the 19th century, Medellin was a dynamic commercial center; first exporting gold, then producing and exporting coffee. It was the first in the country to take part in the Industrial Revolution. Medellin today echoes that kind of vigor. It has undergone a renewal much like the rest of the country. It is home to several universities, adding to the cultural scene and energetic nightlife. It is Colombia&#x2019;s main industrial center, producing everything from designer clothing to cars. Medellin has the only aerial cables connected to a mass metro-type transport system. The city&#x2019;s architecture includes five &#x201C;Library Parks&#x201D; that are symbols of the urban and social transformation of Medellin.

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Santa Marta &amp;amp; Tayrona National Park:&lt;/strong&gt; Founded in 1525, Santa Marta was the first Spanish settlement on Colombia&#x2019;s Caribbean coast. &#xA0;Gold was the main reason the Spanish settled here. &#xA0;Local Taironas were celebrated as goldsmiths.&#xA0; The natural harbor made it easy to ship the gold to Spain.&#xA0; Santa Marta is an ideal base for discovering the Santa Marta Mountains and Tayrona National Park.&#xA0; The park has one of the most scenic coastlines with hiking trails, beautiful beaches, secluded bays and coral reefs.&#xA0; It protects some 108 species of mammals and 300 species of birds as well as more than 70 types of bats.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Zipaquir&#xE1; Salt Cathedral &amp;amp; Villa de Leyva:&lt;/strong&gt; The name Zipaquir&#xE1; refers to Zipa, the leader of the Muisca tribe and the overlord of these rich salt mines. With over 500 years of history, the mine has a large chamber with mirrors of salt water.&#xA0; The Salt Cathedral has 14 Stations of the Cross, an enormous cross carved into the rock and the three naves of the cathedral that represent the birth, life and death of Christ.&#xA0; Villa de Leyva is a beautiful town, founded in 1572. &#xA0;In colonial times, the Spanish Viceroy spent much time there.&#xA0; The city is a colonial jewel with an enormous plaza surrounded by colonial-style houses, cobblestone streets and the 17th-century parochial church.&#xD;

&lt;h4&gt;Best Time to Travel to Colombia&#xD;
Festivals &amp;amp; Special Events&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;With its proximity to the Equator, Colombia maintains relatively constant temperature all year.&#xA0; Altitude determines the temperature ranges.&#xA0; The best time to visit is December through February, and then June through August.&#xA0; These are also the best periods to see Colombia&#x2019;s colorful festivals, which means that some of the more popular areas may be crowded from late December to mid-January and mid-June to mid-July.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Baranquilla Carnival was designated by UNESCO to be a World Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.&#xA0; It features four days of vibrant parades, elaborate costumes, energetic dancing and lively music.&#xA0; The main parades take place on the three days preceding Ash Wednesday.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Medellin Flower Fair, in August, Medell&#xED;n, the &#x201C;city of eternal spring,&#x201D; comes into full bloom.&#xA0; More than 140 events include a horse fair, an orchestra festival, national singing festival, an old and classic cars parade, and musical performances.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Jazz in the Park Festival in Bogot&#xE1; in September means that the Colombian capital fills with music.&#xA0; The two-day festival takes place in several parks and other venues throughout the city.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Bogot&#xE1;'s Carnival is celebrated August 5 and 6 every year to commemorate its Hispanic foundation, and its cultural and musical diversity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;South Caribbean Coast:&lt;/strong&gt; Wild and beautiful with pounding surf, gorgeous white sand beaches and prehistoric rainforests, Costa Rica&#x2019;s Caribbean Coast is ideal for nature lovers. &#xA0;Inland rainforests reach all the way down to touch the coastline. &#xA0;Christopher Columbus landed along here in 1502.&#xA0; The country&#x2019;s 201 kilometers/125 miles of shoreline lies within Limon province.&#xA0; Yet, this province is one of the country&#x2019;s least traveled areas. &#xA0;It has outstanding diving and snorkeling locations and superb sport fishing. &#xA0;Cahuita National Park is also home to some of the last indigenous Indian communities of Costa Rica.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Tortuguero National Park:&lt;/strong&gt; Encompassing 11 different habitats from rainforest to marsh, it protects a fabulous array of wildlife, including more than 375 bird species, 57 species of amphibians and 111 varieties of reptiles, including three types of marine turtles, and 60 mammal species.&#xA0; Here, 13 of Costa Rica&#x2019;s 16 endangered animals are found, including jaguars, tapirs, ocelots, cougars and manatees.&#xA0; This is also an important sea turtle nesting site from June to October. &#xA0;It is the thirdmost visited park in Costa Rica, even though it is only reachable by air or boat.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Turrialba Volcano National Park:&lt;/strong&gt; This area is a great option for travelers who want to explore more off-the-beaten-path areas. &#xA0;Hiking up the volcano is a popular option. &#xA0;Others adventures range from horseback riding, to mountain biking, to whitewater rafting. &#xA0;The volcano is still active, but the last major eruptions were in mid-1800s.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Uvita &amp;amp; Dominical:&lt;/strong&gt; Just south of the more popular Manuel Antonio, this area is less sophisticated than other Costa Rica locales, but with a spectacular rainforest. &#xA0;It is a great base for exploring Corcovado National Park.&#xA0; Dominical and Uvita are beach-front towns known for surfing. &#xA0;Both are growing but still retain that small casual attitude. &#xA0;Rock climbing, zip lining, parasailing and boating are possible.&#xD;

Festivals &amp;amp; Special Events&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;High season for Costa Rica tourism is from late November until April, the dry season; especially so around Christmas and spring break/Easter week.&#xA0; The rainy season runs from May through mid-November.&#xA0; Most of Costa Rica receives rain at nearly the same time on most days, making planning easier.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Palmares Civic Fiestas, the second and third weeks of January, is one of the largest traditional fiestas,&#xA0;including bullfights, concerts, carnival rides and loads of local foods to sample.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Juan Santamar&#xED;a Day, on April 11, commemorates Costa Rica's national hero:&#xA0; the barefoot soldier who gave his life in the battle against William Walker's troops in 1856. Week-long celebrations feature marching bands, parades, concerts, and dances.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Guanacaste Day, on July 25, celebrates the annexation of the "Partido de Nicoya" in 1824, known today as Guanacaste, with fiestas, folk dances, cattle shows, bullfights and concerts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Independence Day, September 15, is celebrated by most of Central America.&#xA0; The Freedom Torch is brought from Nicaragua by student relay runners the day before, arriving in Cartago with Costa Rican relay teams at 6 p.m. on the 15th.&#xA0; Everyone stops what they're doing and sings the National Anthem.&#xA0; There are parades, marching bands, parties, and more.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>Custom Guatemala, Honduras &amp; Nicaragua</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About&#xA0;Guatemala,&#xA0;Honduras &amp;amp; Nicaragua Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antigua&lt;/strong&gt;: A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Antigua in the central highlands is famous for well-preserved Spanish Baroque and colonial architecture as seen in its elegant historic homes, palaces, cathedrals and churches including San Francisco Church, the cathedral, central park and La Merced Church. The area is a mosaic of wild forests, streams, Indian villages and farms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chichicastenango&lt;/strong&gt;: In the Guatemala highlands, this large indigenous town spreads out on the crests of mountaintops at an altitude of 1,965 meters/6,447 feet.&#xA0; It is known for its traditional K&#x2019;iche&#x2019; Mayan culture.&#xA0; Here, one of the more famous markets takes place on Thursdays and Sundays.&#xA0; Vendors sell all manner of goods - handicrafts, food, pottery, medicinal plants, pigs, chickens, machetes and textiles.&#xA0; The city is also known for the manufacture of carved wooden masks used in traditional dances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copan&lt;/strong&gt;: In western Honduras, Copan boasts impressive Mayan creations such as intricately carved stelae, striking carved inscriptions and an amazing hieroglyphic stairway.&#xA0; The city sits next to the Guatemalan border.&#xA0; The ancient kingdom flourished from the fifth century to the early ninth century, with earlier groups dating back to the second century.&#xA0; The Mayan civilization began a marked decline in the ninth century, so by the time the Spanish arrived, the city had been abandoned to the jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flores&lt;/strong&gt;: Flores sits on an island in Lake Peten Itza, and is connected by a causeway to the mainland and its two sister towns of Santa Elena and San Benito.&#xA0; All three are often referred to as Flores. Close to Tikal, Flores is a charming city worth exploring with its colonial, red-roofed buildings, narrow cobblestone streets, historic church and open plaza. It is also close to Yaxh&#xE1; National Park, the first multi-disciplinary project involving archaeologists, architects, restaurateurs, biologists and workers.&#xA0; It embraces more than 500 discovered buildings, including the only twin pyramid complex outside of Tikal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Granada&lt;/strong&gt;:&#xA0; Established in 1524,&#xA0;Granada is the oldest European-founded city in Nicaragua, the second oldest in Central America, and the third oldest in the Americas.&#xA0;It grew up on the shores of&#xA0;the great lake of Nicaragua.&#xA0;Named after the city of Granada in Spain, the city&#xA0;reveals its history&#xA0;in its&#xA0;colonial churches, narrow streets and large homes built around beautiful indoor patios.&#xA0;Sites include La Merced Church, the museum within Casa de los Tres Mundos, the colonial house of the Zamora family, who has lived here for generations, and the San Francisco Convent. The convent, and the church it is attached to, was first erected in 1525, but&#xA0; pirates burned down the convent 1665. Today the convent-cum-museum is noted for its ancient catacombs beneath the convent and church. Priests and other citizens of Granada have been buried there beginning in 1546. An estimated 75,000 people have been buried in the catacombs&#x2019; walls.&#xA0; UNESCO is considering listing the Granada as a Heritage of Mankind Site.&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iximche&lt;/strong&gt;: This Mayan ruin sits in the Western highlands of Guatemala in Tecpan between Antigua and Lake Atitlan.&#xA0; It is not as well-known as the major archaeological sites of the Classic Period (250 to 900). It served as the capital of the Kaqchikel Maya from 1470 to 1524.&#xA0; Here, visitors can witness an authentic Mayan shaman ritual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Jicaro Island&lt;/strong&gt;: &#xA0;This private island is just a few minutes boat ride from the colonial town of Granada in Nicaragua. It boasts spectacular views of the Mombacho Volcano and other small islands in Lake Granada. &#xA0;Ages ago, when Mombacho Volcano erupted, 365 isletas were created, including Jicaro.&#xA0; Now it is an upscale nature resort developed in harmony with its surroundings and with the local community. It is&#xA0;a true ecolodge &#x2013; from water and energy generation, to local, organic foods, to employing local staff. Activities include stellar bird watching, kayaking, yoga classes, zip lining, hiking a volcano and artisanal fishing, in the tradition of local fishermen.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;La Flor Wildlife Refuge&lt;/strong&gt;: The refuge is made up of one of the most beautiful beaches on the south Pacific coastline. &#xA0;The pure white sand is bordered by tropical forests on one side and the Pacific Ocean on the other. The reserve is small, just 800 hectares/1,977 acres, but here some 30,000 Olive Ridley turtles arrive each year to mate. The nesting season begins in July and lasts until January. The peak months are October and November. This is one of the most vital coastal sea turtle breeding sites in the Pacific Ocean. &#xA0;The reserve also encompasses tropical dry forests and mangroves that support monkeys, Garrobo Negro, coyotes, raccoons, iguana verde, skunks, legartijas, and a hosts of birds.&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lake Atitlan&lt;/strong&gt;: The Guatemalan lake is volcanic in origin, filling an enormous caldera formed in an eruption some 84,000 years ago.&#xA0; It is the deepest lake in Central America with maximum depth about 340 meters/1,115 feet.&#xA0; The lake is shaped by surrounding escarpments, three volcanoes on its southern flank.&#xA0; The majority of inhabitants of the region are of Mayan ancestry.&#xA0; The Tz&#x2019;utujil culture belongs to one of 21 Maya ethnic groups in Guatemala.&#xA0; The Tz&#x2019;utujil people are noted for maintaining cultural practices in their distinctive embroidered dress and mud-and-thatch homes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Lake Nicaragua&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the largest lake in Central America, the 19th largest lake in the world by area, and the 9th largest in the Americas. It is slightly smaller than Lake Titicaca, and sits at an elevation of 32.7 meters/107 ft above sea level.&#xA0; It reaches a depth of 26 meters/85 feet and has an area of 8,264 km2/3,191 sq mi. &#xA0;The lake was used by Caribbean pirates who assaulted Granada on three occasions. Before construction began on the Panama Canal, a stagecoach line owned by Cornelius Vanderbilt's Accessory Transit Company connected the lake with the Pacific Ocean across the low hills of the narrow isthmus. &#xA0;Lake Nicaragua, despite being a freshwater lake, has sawfish, tarpon and bull sharks, a species also known for entering freshwater elsewhere around the world. Numerous other species of fish live in the lake, including at least 16 species of endemic cichlids. There is ongoing concerns about the ecological condition of this scenic lake.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Leon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; This is the second largest city in Nicaragua. Le&#xF3;n is located along the Chiquito River, some 90 kilometers/56 miles northwest of Managua&#xA0; For a long time Le&#xF3;n was the political and intellectual center of the nation and is home to its National Autonomous University of Nicaragua.&#xA0; Founded in 1813, the university is the second oldest in Central America. Le&#xF3;n is also an important industrial, agricultural and commercial center for Nicaragua, producing sugar cane, cattle, peanut, plantain and sorghum. The first city named Le&#xF3;n in Nicaragua was founded in 1524 by Francisco Hern&#xE1;ndez de C&#xF3;rdoba about 32 kilometers/20 miles east of its present site, but a series of earthquakes in 1610 left the city in ruins and forced its evacuation. The ruins, now known as "Le&#xF3;n Viejo," were excavated in 1960 and in 2000, the site was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. &#xA0;The Leon Cathedral is a significantly important and historic landmark in Nicaragua and was itself awarded UNESCO World Heritage Site status. The site's nomination is Nicaragua's third cultural landmark, following the ruins of Le&#xF3;n Viejo and &lt;i&gt;El G&#xFC;eg&#xFC;ense&lt;/i&gt;, Nicaragua's signature folkloric masterpiece combining&#xA0;music, dance and theater proclaimed by UNESCO to be a "Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity."&#xA0;&#xA0; The city is also home to the birthplace of Ruben Dario, considered the father of modern Spanish literature, and the Ortiz Gurdian Art Gallery, known as one of the best private art galleries in Latin America.&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Livingston&lt;/strong&gt;: Livingston sits at the mouth of the Rio Dulce at the Gulf of Honduras.&#xA0; On Guatemala&#x2019;s Caribbean Coast, it is noted for its unusual mix of Gar&#xED;funa, Afro-Caribbean, Maya and Ladino people and culture.&#xA0; The town was Guatemala&#x2019;s main port until the construction of nearby Puerto Barrios.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Managua&lt;/strong&gt;: Founded in 1819, Managua is the capital and largest city in Nicaragua. Located on the southwestern shore of Lake Xolotl&#xE1;n or Lake Managua, the city became the national capital in 1852. Prior to that, the capital&#xA0; alternated between Le&#xF3;n and Granada. The city is the second most populous city in Central America, after Guatemala City. Originally a rural fishing village, efforts to make it the capital city began in 1824, after the Central American nations formally attained their independence from Spain. Managua's location between the rival cities of Le&#xF3;n and Granada made it a logical and ideal compromise. Modern Managua sits on a fault line, making it susceptible to severe earthquakes.&#xA0; It is&#xA0; Nicaragua's chief trading center for coffee, cotton and other crops as well as its beer, matches, textiles and shoes.&#xA0; It serves as an important industrial, commercial, political and cultural center. The &lt;i&gt;Ancient Footprints of Acahualinca&lt;/i&gt;, are fossilized human footprints from the Late Holocene era that were left behind in volcanic ash and mud, which solidified about 2,000 years ago. The "Museo Sitio Huellas de Acahualinca" is west of Managua in the town of Acahualinca. The little museum was founded in 1953. In addition to footprints, the museum features a small collection of pottery and other items of archaeological interest from several sites in Nicaragua.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Masaya Volcano &amp;amp; Area&lt;/strong&gt;: This is Nicaragua's first and largest National Park, one of 78 protected areas in Nicaragua. The complex volcano is composed of a set of nested calderas and craters, the largest of which is Las Sierras shield volcano and caldera. The park was established in 1979, and encompasses cloud forest and a beautiful volcanic lake, Masaya Lagoon.&#xA0;&#xA0;It also features an environmental interpretation center, with a model of the park, paintings by Nicaraguan artists showing the geological history of the volcano and information about the tectonic plates that formed it. The park's wildlife includes coyotes, skunks, raccoons, opossums, deer, iguanas, and monkeys. A short distance away is the Masaya Arts and Crafts Market, considered by many to be the greatest craft hub in Central America. Best known for the 19th century artisan market, common crafts include hammocks, leather, fabric and wood items as well as local ceramics.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Matagalpa&lt;/strong&gt;: Matagalpa is Nicaragua's sixth largest city and one of its most commercially active outside of Managua. Matagalpa is the second most important city in Nicaragua and is known as the "Pearl of the North" and "Land of Eternal Spring." Matagalpa was originally an indigenous village. The Matagalpa&#xD;
Indians had their own language, which has been extinct since 1875, and created ceramics in a style known as "Ceramica Negra" and "Naranja Segovia."&#xA0; They also created stone statues representing their chieftain and warriors. &#xA0;The Spanish feared their bravery and skill with bows. Indeed, Spain tried to subdue them for 300 years, and they were never fully successful. Matagalpa is located on&#xA0;the continental divide between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Gold was discovered around Matagalpa by 1840, attracting many Spanish, German, American and British immigrants, including Ludwig Elster and his wife Katharina Braun. They were the first to plant coffee trees in the area and successfully so.&#xA0; The beans quickly went to market in Germany. Coffee agriculture attracted more than 120 European immigrants, many of whom married Matagalpan women. Many of their descendants still live in the area. Today, coffee producers such the Selva Negra Sustainable Farm are&#xA0;recognized for pioneering innovative and sustainable farming methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Rivas&lt;/strong&gt;: Located on an isthmus between the Pacific Ocean and Lake Nicaragua, Rivas has a unique location with two coasts right across from one another.&#xA0; The indigenous tribes settled in the area around 606 AD, with the first Europeans, the Spanish, arriving in 1522. The Catholic Church was built in 1607 while the city of Rivas wasn&#x2019;t officially recognized until 1835. Its colonial roots can be seen in the old churches scattered throughout the town and the cemetery.&#xA0; The Museum of Anthropology and History has pre-Columbian artifacts and historical paintings as well as historical documents that outline Nicaragua's turbulent past.&#xA0; The city has a large market and a variety of shops.&#xA0; It is known for its beaches and fishing. Other activities include&#xA0;a zip line canopy tour of the rainforest treetops, bird watching and hiking on nearby Ometepe Island, and surfing off the island of San Juan del Sur, a fishing village.&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roatan Island&lt;/strong&gt;: Near the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, the largest barrier reef in the Caribbean Sea, Roatan is an important cruise ship and scuba diving destination in Honduras.&#xA0; The pre-Colombian indigenous peoples of the Bay Islands are believed to have been related to Paya, Maya, Lenca or Jicaque, which were the mainland cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tikal&lt;/strong&gt;: The country&#x2019;s most priceless gem, Tikal ranks among the great ancient cities of the world. This epic site&#x2019;s towering pyramids loom out of the thick jungle canopy like stoic sentinels of ancient mysteries. It was once an affluent city complex with more than 100,000 inhabitants, and the seat of power for the Jaguar clan lords.&#xA0; The site was discovered by outsiders in 1848. Tikal is mesmerizing in its elegance and scale. This UNESCO Heritage of Humanity Site includes a staggering 3,000 or so structures: palaces, temples, plazas, ceremonial platforms, ball courts, terraces, avenues and steam baths. The Maya began Tikal about 600 BC, and for the next 1,500 years it served as an important religious, scientific and political center.&#xA0; Tikal National Park is also home to howler monkeys, boisterous parrots, white-lipped peccary, brocket deer, coati mundi, toucans, scarlet macaws, ocelots and the rare jaguar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uaxactun:&lt;/strong&gt; Uaxactun is one of the longest-occupied Mayan sites.&#xA0; It is also a community where traditional &#x201C;Chicleros&#x201D; (gum Collectors) have lived for over 100 years. Many residents now make their living from gathering forest products including chicle, allspice and xate palm leaves, used in floral arrangements.&#xA0; Travelers explore the Mayan site and encounter this traditional community to learn about their lives.&#xA0; Guests overnight at a tented campsite in the middle of the jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

	&lt;li&gt;Honduras&#x2019; climate varies from tropical in the lowlands to temperate in the mountains. The central and southern regions are hotter but less humid than the northern coast. The low-lying coastal regions are warmer, and the humidity can be oppressive.&#xA0; The dry season prevails November-May.&#xA0; Average daytime temperatures run in low to upper 27&#xB0;C/80&#xB0;F year round.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Nicaragua is considered to have two main travel seasons: the rainy season and the dry season. The most popular travel season is typically between January and April as the weather is driest. The wettest parts of the year occur between May and October. For sport fishing enthusiasts, April to July is generally considered to be the best season.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Panama&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Bocas del Toro:&lt;/strong&gt; Christopher Columbus anchored here in 1502.&#xA0; By the turn of the 20th century, the town was headquarters for the United Fruit Company, and had 25,000 inhabitants, six consuls and five newspapers.&#xA0; That ended with a banana blight in the 1920s.&#xA0; The archipelago consists of six densely forested islands, scores of uninhabited islets and Parque Nacional Marino Isla Bastimentos, Panama&#x2019;s oldest marine park.&#xA0; The town is at the southern tip of Colon Island in the Bocas del Toro Archipelago.&#xA0; The province contains another national park, La Amistad International Park.&#xA0; The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute operates a research station here.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Chiriqu&#xED; Highlands:&lt;/strong&gt; Chiriqui Province in western Panama, near Costa Rica, encompasses primary forests that harbor orchids and unique endemic wildlife, including the fabled resplendent Quetzal. Indian cultures, coffee plantations, hiking and horseback riding are here to be experienced.&#xA0; David is the provincial capital city and offers excellent shopping. &#xA0;Chiriqui Province is known for rafting and kayaking adventures, including Class Five rapids.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Colon:&lt;/strong&gt; On the Caribbean side, Panama Canal transits start and end here. Highlights include the San Lorenzo and Portobello fortresses, the state-of-the art cruise port and the largest Free Trade Zone outside Hong Kong.&#xA0; This province not only offers historical sites and shopping, it is also a perfect place for nature activities such as snorkeling, diving and rainforest hiking within world-class birding areas. &#xA0;It is a relaxing spot to enjoy the Caribbean atmosphere.&#xA0; Colon province features the Panama Railroad and the lush tropical Isla Grande just off the coast.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Embera Village:&lt;/strong&gt; The Choco or Embera people live in small villages of five to 20 houses along the banks of the rivers throughout the Chucunaque/Tuira/Balsas River watersheds in the Darien Province. &#xA0;The villages are about a half day&#x2019;s walk apart. &#xA0;They are built on a small rise, set approximately 100 feet in from the river. &#xA0;Around each village, the jungle is partly cleared and replaced by banana and plantain plantations, a commercial crop for the Embera.&#xA0; They have their own form of government and live by their own unwritten rules. &#xA0;Health care is primarily provided by trained Shamans.&#xA0; The land is owned and farmed by the entire community. &#xA0;If a hunter gets a larger animal such as a peccary or a tapir, everybody in the village shares it. &#xA0;Embera woman sell coiled basket and other crafts.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Panama Canal &amp;amp; Cruise Between The Seas:&lt;/strong&gt; The earliest mention of a canal through Panama dates to 1534, the king of Spain commissioned a survey to discover a shorter route between Spain and Peru. &#xA0;But the first construction efforts didn&#x2019;t begin for 349 years! &#xA0;After several failed attempts by others, the United States completed the present canal in 1913. &#xA0;It remains a vital link in world shipping.&#xA0; Transits of the 82-kilometer/51-mile canal can either be a full day or a shorter partial voyage. &#xA0;The Cruise Between the Seas is a seven-day cruise that explores the world of the Embera Indians, the wildlife and the ecosystem of the region. &#xA0;The cruise also includes a Panama Canal transit, Pearl Islands of San Telmo and Mogo Mogo; Chagres River; and Portobelo, founded by Christopher Columbus in 1597. &#xA0;There are opportunities to snorkel, swim, kayak and hike.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Panama City:&lt;/strong&gt; Founded in 1517, the city has long been an international crossroads. It was the first city built on the Pacific Coast of the Americas by the Spanish. The thriving business district includes shops, fine restaurants and lively nightclubs strung along the beautiful bay. The Spanish architectural influence is found in the 17thcentury convents and churches such as the Church of the Golden Altar. In addition to the famed canal, other sights include the original dungeons, a French monument to the 22,000 workers who died building the canal, and the Panama Canal Museum. The Amador Causeway connects three small islands that also have fine restaurants, bike and walking paths, a Smithsonian Institute research aquarium and a marina.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Soberania National Park:&lt;/strong&gt; This national park offers outstanding natural attractions within its 20,234 hectares/50,000 acres of pristine rainforest. Some 105 species of mammals here include jaguar, white-tailed deer, wild pigs and monkeys, including the small mono titi and the evasive jujana.&#xA0; For 19 years, the Audubon Society has taken an annual census. &#xA0;In one day in 1996, they recorded 525 species of birds.&#xA0; On Gatun Lake, part of the Panama Canal complex, it is common to see three species of monkeys as well as crocodiles and iguanas. &#xA0;Bird-watching, fishing and jungle boat tours are available. &#xA0;Water sport enthusiasts can venture out on kayaks past lush rainforest, or paddle from Gatun Lake to Fort San Lorenzo on the Atlantic Coast.&#xA0; Chagres River was used in colonial days to transport gold and silver from Peru to Colon and eventually on to Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;San Blas Islands:&lt;/strong&gt; San Blas Archipelago encompasses some 365 islands, many of which define the clich&#xE9; of a &#x2018;tropical paradise.&#x2019;&#xA0; Quiet beaches, secluded coves plus the full range of water sports, including sailing, sea kayaking and snorkeling, make the San Blas Islands a very appealing retreat. The islands are also home to the traditional villages of the San Blas Indians, the Kuna, who are famous for their mola embroideries (reverse appliqu&#xE9; embroidery with colorful tropical designs). Accommodations are basic and rustic.&#xD;

&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Panama is a year-round destination with two seasons: &#xA0;wet and dry.&#xA0; It can be rainy anytime, but November to March is the drier time of the year.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Carnival is&#xA0;celebrated in February on the four days leading up to Ash Wednesday.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Panama Jazz Festival is held every January in Panama City. &#xA0;This week-long music festival showcases international jazz artists.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Festival of the Black Christ is celebrated on October 21 in the town of Portobelo.&#xA0; Pilgrims come from all over Panama to witness the parade, which features a life-sized Black Christ statue.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;In January, the Chiriqui Highlands hosts a popular 10-day Flower and Coffee Festival.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Peru Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Jungle:&lt;/strong&gt; This is one of the most biologically diverse locations in the world. &#xA0;Wildlife is abundant such as jacanas, macaws, howlers and squirrel monkeys, primates and sloths. &#xA0;River trips explore the confluence of the Ucayali and Maranon Rivers, and the point where the Amazon River takes its name. &#xA0;Riverbank settlements offer the chance to engage with indigenous people.&#xA0; Daily activities vary due to season or prevailing conditions each day, but the list of options includes birding watching treks, boat journeys, swimming, fishing and canopy tours. &#xA0;Another option is to explore Amazonia from a jungle lodge.&#xA0; Guests set their own pace whether that is a siesta, a guided walk, or a nighttime view of the Southern Hemisphere sky.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Arequipa, Colca Canyon &amp;amp; Lake Titicaca:&lt;/strong&gt; Arequipa, Peru&#x2019;s second largest city is often acclaimed as its most beautiful.&#xA0; This &#x2018;&#x201D;white city&#x201D; was built using volcanic stone.&#xA0; The Spanish founded Arequipa in 1540.&#xA0; Landmarks include 16th-century Santa Catalina Convent and the Plaza de Armas, surrounded by double-storied, arched colonial buildings and a huge cathedral. &#xA0;In the high Andes, Colca Canyon reaches staggering depths of 3,353 meters/11,000 feet, twice the depth of the Grand Canyon.&#xA0; This is the land of the great Andean condor.&#xA0; Lake Titicaca on the border of Bolivia and Peru is the world&#x2019;s highest navigable body of water at more than 3,658 meters/12,000 feet.&#xA0; This scenic lake is known also for the Uros culture, many of whom live on dozens of the floating reed islands.&#xA0; Established in 1668, Puno is the capital and largest city the region. &#xA0;It spreads along the shores of the lake, and is considered the folklore capital of Peru for its artistic and cultural expressions, especially in dance. &#xA0;Pre-Inca ruins are found here, too.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Cusco &amp;amp; Urubamba (Sacred) Valley:&lt;/strong&gt; At about 3,353 meters/11,000 feet, Cusco basks in the bright, cool high-altitude sunlight.&#xA0; It is brimming with Incan and Spanish treasures, cobblestone streets, lovely plazas and small shops offering everything from upscale clothing to traditional crafts.&#xA0; It has fine hotels and restaurants. &#xA0;Urubamba Valley is home to outstanding archaeological remains. &#xA0;It was one of the Incan empire&#x2019;s primary points for producing maize.&#xA0; Many descendants of the Inca carry on the traditions of their ancestors. &#xA0;Pisaq Indian Market is open daily, but the best day to visit is Sunday when locals go to market.&#xA0; The village of Chinchero is home to artists skilled at back-strap weaving, a technique handed down through generations. Some designs date back two millennia.&#xA0; Willoq is an Andean community also known for unique textile designs produced by women and girls. Ollantaytambo has Incan fortress ruins. &#xA0;The Moray Incan terraces were perhaps an agricultural experiment station.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Inca Trail:&lt;/strong&gt; The six-day trek along the mythic Inca Trail travels the Piscacucho/Huayllabamba route along some of the very same trails used by ancient Incas.&#xA0; This high-altitude hike crosses rivers, cloud forest, valleys and mountain passes as high as Warmiwa&#xF1;usqa Pass at 4,199 meters/13,776 feet. The final section of the trail is a stunningly beautiful traverse leading to the Sun Gate, which overlooks the citadel of Machu Picchu. &#xA0;Hiking the Inca trail has become a grand challenge, but its high altitude requires walkers to be in good physical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Lima:&lt;/strong&gt; Peru&#x2019;s capital city stretches along the Pacific Ocean.&#xA0; Founded in 1535, it was the seat of Spanish power in the New World for 300 years.&#xA0; In the 17th century, it had a trading network that stretched to Europe and the Philippines. The city center is noted for colonial architecture such as Plaza de Armas, presidential palace, the ornate 16th-century cathedral and the catacombs of the Convento de San Francisco.&#xA0; Lima enjoys a legacy of art from its colonial period.&#xA0; Its museums are bursting with artifacts of gold, ceramic and weavings.&#xA0; The Rafael Larco Herrera Archaeological Museum has a captivating collection of pre-Inca artifacts &#x2013; pottery, gold and silver works, mummies, and more.&#xA0; It also features a one-of-kind collection of erotic ceramics from the Chimu, Mohica and other Pre-Inca civilizations. &#xA0;Lima&#x2019;s renowned cuisine fuses Andean and Spanish traditions with influences from many countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Machu Picchu:&lt;/strong&gt; The 15th-century Lost City of the Incas is more than just a place to visit.&#xA0; These stone ruins are as much about an experience as about a destination. &#xA0;Machu Picchu stands at an altitude of 2,430 meters/7,972 feet in an extraordinarily beautiful setting.&#xA0; It was an amazing urban creation with its giant walls, terraces and ramps, which seems as if they have been cut naturally in the continuous rock escarpments.&#xA0; For many, it is an extraordinary, spiritual experience; and for everyone, it is dazzling and dramatic.&#xA0; It was built around 1460 AD, but abandoned as an official site for the Inca rulers 100 years later during the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire. &#xA0;It is classic Inca style with polished dry-stone walls.&#xA0; Mysteries still linger such as how the Inca moved the large rocks they used to construct the city.&#xA0; Each stone block was carefully carved to fit with the other stones without cement or mortar.&#xA0; Machu Picchu is quite simply mesmerizing.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Nazca Lines &amp;amp; Paracas:&lt;/strong&gt; A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the fascinating Nazca Lines are enigmatic figures in the desert that are 2,000 years old. &#xA0;Many questions remain as to their origins and purpose. &#xA0;The patterns of lines are put into perspective from the air, when they transform into monkey, spider, bird, fish and reptile, ranging in size up to 305 meters/1,000 feet.&#xA0; Scenic flights from Ica (weather permitting) fly above these ancient earth drawings. &#xA0;The resort town of Paracas, nearby, is where the desert and the sea come together. The Paracas culture was an important Andean society between approximately 750 BC and 100 AD. &#xA0;It was known for the high quality of its textiles and weavings.&#xA0; Cliffs that are home to millions of birds rim the town&#x2019;s beaches. Boats cruise out to see the Islas Ballestas, where the wildlife has been likened to the Galapagos.&#xA0; No boats land on these islands to protect the colonies of sea lion, Humboldt penguin and seabirds.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Tambopata National Reserve:&lt;/strong&gt; Tambopata National Reserve is part of the great Tambopata Madidi Wilderness on the Peru-Bolivia border. &#xA0;The Tambopata River watershed is one of the world&#x2019;s richest ecosystems in terms of biodiversity.&#xA0; The area includes forest species of economic importance such as cedar, mahogany and palm trees as well as endangered giant river otters and vulnerable species such as the anteater, giant armadillo, black spider monkey, jaguar, pink river dolphin, yellow-headed river turtle and the anaconda. &#xA0;Tambopata National Reserve is also strikingly beautiful with lush vegetation, rivers and cascading waterfalls.&#xA0; The reserve and Bahuaja-Sonene National Park have been listed as vulnerable due to threats that include gold mining, illegal logging and excessive extraction of other natural resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Undiscovered Peru:&lt;/strong&gt; Several ancient cultures occupied the areas around Trujillo, Chiclayo and Cajamarca. &#xA0;Trujillo has a cathedral, ten lovely colonial churches, convents and monasteries. &#xA0;It serves as a base to visit Chan Chan, the largest pre-Columbian city in South America. &#xA0;Chan Chan was built 850 and lasted until its conquest by the Inca Empire in 1470. &#xA0;Chiclayo, once a rural Indian village, has a neoclassical cathedral and a daily market. &#xA0;Near Chiclayo is the Sipan, an imposing complex where excavations have yielded fine examples of pre-Colombian art. &#xA0;In the most extravagant Moche tomb, some 1800 years old, El Senor de Sipan, a priest, was found clad in gold, and with turquoise and other valuables.&#xA0; The Bruning Museum, north of Chiclayo in Lambayeque, specializes in Mochica, Lambayeque, Chimu and Vicus cultures, and has a fine collection of Sipan and Lambayeque gold. &#xA0;Cajamarca in the northern highlands dates back more than 2,000 years with traces of pre Chav&#xED;n cultures that can still be seen in surrounding sites. &#xA0;Cajamarca is considered the place where the Inca Empire ended when Spanish soldiers captured and later killed the last Incan emperor.&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;h4&gt;Best Time to&#xA0;Travel to&#xA0;Peru&#xD;
Festivals and Special Events&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Peru has wet summers December to March, and dry winter months between April and November.&#xA0; Its varied terrains means there are regional variations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The coastal region is hot and sunny in summer.&#xA0; Winter is characterized by cooler temperatures, although still humid.&#xA0; A hazy mist is a frequent occurrence.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;In the Andes, the best time for trekking is June to September when it is driest, even though the nights can be quite cool.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The Amazon jungle is at its best from May to September after heavy rains have subsided, and lower water levels make remote areas more accessible.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The Inti Raymi, "Festival of the Sun,&#x201D; was an important religious ceremony of the Inca Empire, honoring&#xA0;the god Inti, and marking the winter solstice. Since 1944, a theatrical presentation of the Inti Raymi has&#xA0;taken place at Sacsayhuam&#xE1;n, outside Cusco, annually on June 24, attracting thousands of people, both visitors and locals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Alice Springs, Uluru &amp;amp; Kata Tjuta:&lt;/strong&gt; Alice Springs is the second largest town in the Northern Territory, close to the geographic center of Australia. It was once the land of the Aranda people, who inhabited the central desert for thousands of years. &#xA0;The town was originally developed as a station on the overland telegraph line, linking Adelaide to Darwin and Great Britain. &#xA0;Alice Springs&#x2019; desert lifestyle has inspired some unique events such as the Henley-on-Todd Regatta, featuring "boat" races on a waterless riverbed.&#xA0; Uluru (Ayers Rock) is the giant sandstone monolith famed for its theatrical sunrises and sunsets, when the rock glows a dozen shades of red and orange.&#xA0; Uluru and Kata Tjuta (Olgas) are sacred to the aboriginal people and featured in their ancient mythology.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Flinders Ranges:&lt;/strong&gt; Cave paintings, rock engravings and other artifacts indicate that the Adnyamathanha people have lived in the Flinders Ranges for tens of thousands of years.&#xA0; Scientists believe that 500 million years ago the rock layers were squeezed and folded into a long mountain chain.&#xA0; St. Mary Peak, at 1,170 meters/3,839 feet, adjoins the Flinders Ranges National Park. Bird life is rich and varied with more than 100 native species.&#xA0; The area is popular with hikers, cyclists and outdoor enthusiasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Great Barrier Reef &amp;amp; Whitsundays:&lt;/strong&gt; The Great Barrier Reef complex contains a staggering abundance of marine life and comprises of over 3,000 individual reef systems spread along 2,000 kilometers/1,243 miles, and has the world&#x2019;s largest collection of corals &#x2013; some 400 different kinds of coral, coral sponges, mollusks, rays and dolphins. &#xA0;There are more than 1,500 species of tropical fish, 200 types of birds, and 20 types of reptiles that includes sea turtles and giant clams more than 120 years old.&#xA0; This is a breeding area for humpback whales migrating from the Antarctic.&#xA0; In recognition of its vital significance, the reef has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&#xA0; The Whitsundays encompass 74 idyllic and mostly uninhabited islands that coexist with the reef system.&#xA0; They are the closest point off the Queensland coast. The reef, in fact, protects these islands from huge ocean swells.&#xA0; That equates to some of the safest sailing and cruising waters in the world.&#xA0; The Whitsundays stretch 900 kilometers/559 miles north of Brisbane.&#xA0; Hamilton is the largest of Whitesundays islands. &#xA0;Day trips from here to the barrier reef offer opportunities for diving, fishing and whale watching (July-September). &#xA0;Luxury cruises can be privately chartered. Catamarans, kayaks, paddle skis and diving equipment are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Jervis Bay &amp;amp; Lord Howe Island:&lt;/strong&gt; Jervis is known for excellent recreational fishing, scuba diving and whale watching.&#xA0; The majority of whales sighted are migrating humpback whales (June to November), however other species sometimes enter the bay including Southern Right whales, False Killer whales, Orcas and Minke whales. &#xA0;Lord Howe Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique beauty, remarkable geology and rare collection of birds, plants and marine life. &#xA0;The island is an eroded remnant of a seven-million-year-old shield volcano with a coral reef and lagoon. &#xA0;Only 400 visitors are allowed at any one time on this island of unspoiled beauty.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kangaroo Island:&lt;/strong&gt; Covering almost 4,500 square kilometers/1,737 miles, it is Australia&#x2019;s third largest island and offers the best of the mainland on a smaller, more intimate scale. &#xA0;More than a third of the island falls under conservation or national park status offering protection to native residents such as New Zealand fur seals, koalas, kangaroos, Australian sea lions, ospreys and echidnas. &#xA0;The island has a rich cultural heritage.&#xA0; Its dramatic coast, carved landscapes, sheer limestone cliffs, sheltered coves and stretches of sugar-white sand are picture perfect.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kimberley Region:&lt;/strong&gt; The Kimberley was one of the earliest areas of Australia to be settled some 41,000 years ago.&#xA0; Dinosaur footprints 130 million years old are preserved in rock at Gantheaume Point. Broome was once the center of the world&#x2019;s pearling industry.&#xA0; Australia&#x2019;s first south sea pearl farm was at Kuri Bay in the heart of a remote coastline some 220 kilometers/137 miles from the nearest main settlement of Derby.&#xA0; Hidden amid the harshly beautiful and rugged coastline of the Kimberley in northwestern Australia is some remarkably rich and diverse habitat, almost untouched by the modern world. The UNESCO World Heritage listed Purnululu National Park has towering orange-and-black striped rocks of the Bungle Bungle Range, geological formations that rise up to 578 meters/1,896 feet.&#xA0; Kununurra means "big water" to the traditional Aboriginal owners, and vast Lake Argyle meets that description at 1,000 square kilometers/386 square miles. &#xA0;The Kimberley is&#xA0;also home to the Argyle Diamond Mine known for its rare pink diamonds. The Mitchell Plateau is culturally significant with a rich collection of aboriginal art sites. &#xA0;The park also shelters more than 150 bird species and 25 mammal species.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Melbourne:&lt;/strong&gt; About 47 years after the first European settlement in Australia, Melbourne was founded by free settlers in 1835 as a pastoral settlement around the Yarra River. &#xA0;By the 1850s gold rush, it was the second largest in the entire British Empire.&#xA0; It remains a major center of commerce, industry and cultural activity. &#xA0;It is noted for its mix of Victorian and contemporary architecture, an extensive tram network, gardens, museums, galleries and shops.&#xA0; Built in 1878, Queen Victoria Market is a vibrant crossroads of cultures.&#xA0; Phillip Island is fun at dusk when a parade of penguins return to burrows on the island.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Perth, Western Australia &amp;amp; Ningaloo Reef:&lt;/strong&gt; Perth is a city of friendly charm and lovely views.&#xA0; The area encompasses Fremantle, a seaside town with a convict history, modern ocean-racing yachts, terraced houses, museums and galleries set between the Indian Ocean and the Swan River. Dramatic Pinnacle Desert features strange limestone pillars rising out of the sand.&#xA0; Margaret River region is dotted with some 60 wineries.&#xA0; On Western Australia&#x2019;s north coast, Ningaloo Reef has one of the largest reefs in the world that is accessed directly from the beach.&#xA0; Whale sharks, the largest fish in the world, visit the reef between March and June.&#xA0; The reef hosts 200 species of hard corals and over 520 species of fish as well as manta rays, humpback whales, dugongs and turtles.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Port Douglas &amp;amp; Daintree Rainforest:&lt;/strong&gt; Port Douglas, founded in 1877 after the discovery of gold, is a seaside village north of Cairns along an especially scenic coast road.&#xA0; It is huddled at the end of a peninsula with a natural harbor on one side of the village and the sandy sweep of Four Mile Beach on the other. The town features village shops, galleries, historic buildings and the seaside Port Douglas Sunday Market.&#xA0; Daintree Rainforest contains 30% of the frog, reptile and marsupial species in Australia, and a staggering 65% of Australia&#x2019;s bat and butterfly species.&#xA0; About 18% of bird species in the country are here. There are also more than 12,000 species of insects.&#xA0; Daintree National Park is part of the Wet Tropics of Queensland and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Scenic Rim:&lt;/strong&gt; Within easy reach of Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Northern New South Wales, the Scenic Rim is a wonderland of lush rainforests and spectacular landforms and is home to ancient and rare creatures. &#xA0;It also boasts scenic small towns, wineries and art galleries. &#xA0;It is a perfect area for nature walks, and is the gateway to several national parks such as Main Range National Park, Mt. French National Park and Moogerah Peaks National Park.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Sydney &amp;amp; Blue Mountains National Park:&lt;/strong&gt; Radiocarbon dating suggests that the Sydney region has been inhabited for at least 30,000 years. &#xA0;The city is the capital of New South Wales.&#xA0; It was established in 1788 with the arrival of the first British settlers, mostly convicts.&#xA0; The city is known for its distinct skyline, which includes the eccentric Sydney Opera House, Harbour Bridge and the waterfront.&#xA0; The metropolitan area is surrounded by national parks, and has many bays, rivers and inlets as well as a number of excellent beaches. The historic area known as The Rocks takes in the oldest quarter of Sydney, where early convict settlements began.&#xA0; Cobblestone lanes, old neighborhoods, shops, pubs and charming churches weave a rich tapestry of early life here.&#xA0; The Greater Blue Mountains range is a UNESCO World Heritage Wilderness Area. &#xA0;With dramatic gorges up to 760 meters/2,490 feet deep, the park protects rare plants and isolated animals.&#xA0; Leura village thrives in the heart of the park. &#xA0;Spectacular Grose Valley has nature walks and a scenic railway.&#xA0; The 4,000-acre Wolgan Valley Nature Reserve nestles between the Gardens of Stone and Wollemi National Parks. &#xA0;This region is one of the most popular natural landscapes in Australia.&#xA0; Native wildlife includes the iconic kangaroo, wallaroo and wallaby.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Tasmania:&lt;/strong&gt; Tasmania sits about 150 miles off the southern coast of Australia, separated by Bass Strait. &#xA0;It is home to some of the tallest and oldest trees in the world.&#xA0; A stand of Huon pines is estimated to be more than 10,000 years old.&#xA0; Rugged Freycinet Peninsula possesses one of Australia&#x2019;s finest stretches of coast with stunning views across the long curve of Great Oyster Bay. Freycinet National Park&#x2019;s jagged pink and grey granite peaks soar straight out of the water.&#xA0; Cradle Mountain National Park encompasses stands of beech, rainforest and alpine lands. &#xA0;Settled in 1803, Hobart is Australia&#x2019;s smallest capital city. &#xA0;Many of its convict-built sandstone buildings have been preserved. &#xA0;Bordering the national park is the small settlement of Coles Bay. Secluded Wineglass Bay is considered by many as one of the world&#x2019;s ten best beaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Top End:&lt;/strong&gt; The Top End of the Northern Territory is known for its tropical weather, indigenous culture, national parks and a casual, outdoor lifestyle. Northern Australia is a vast region stretching from the Kimberley Plateau of Western Australia through the Top End of the Northern Territory to the tip of Queensland&#x2019;s Cape York.&#xA0; Included in that area are Arnhem Land, Kakadu and Bamurru Plains.&#xA0;They embrace some of the most melodramatic landscapes and aboriginal sites in Australia. &#xA0;Arnhem Land is set amid a quarter of a million acres of pristine wilderness, and is part of the aboriginal homelands. Mt. Borradaile is known for its prehistoric rock art. Bamurru Plains is located on the edge of the Mary River floodplains just a short distance from the coast. It is set in the heart of Swim Creek Station, a privately owned buffalo station on the boundary of Kakadu National Park, renowned for its 5,000 ancient rock art sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Wine Regions:&lt;/strong&gt; Some of the first vine cuttings brought to the new penal colony came from the South in 1788. &#xA0;Today, Australia is the world&#x2019;s fourth largest exporter of wine. &#xA0;Wine is produced in every state, with more than 60 designated wine regions totaling 160,000 hectares/478,396 acres. Most of Australia&#x2019;s wine regions are in the southern, cooler parts of the country, with vineyards located in South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland.&#xA0; The wine regions produce distinctive varieties that take advantage of the each area&#x2019;s soil and climate differences. Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Semillon, Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sauvignon Blanc are the major wines produced.&#xD;

&lt;h4&gt;Best Time to Travel to&#xA0;Australia&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;Festivals &amp;amp; Special Events&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Australia is roughly equivalent to the U.S.A. in size with many variations in climate.&#xA0; Summer lasts December to February; and is the rainy season in the tropical north. November &#x2013; March are hottest.&#xA0; Spring and autumn are mild and the best time for bush walks.&#xA0; Winter, June &#x2013; August, is mild with snow in southern mountains and balmy temperatures in the north.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Australia has many regattas such as Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, December, and Darwin&#x2019;s Beer Can Regatta, July.&#xA0; The mock Henley-on-Todd Regatta in Alice Springs, in about September, sports &#x201C;boats&#x201D; made of anything, including modified trucks.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Jazz in the Vines at Tyrrell's Vineyard, in October, is one of Australia's most significant outdoor jazz events.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Brisbane International Film Festival, in July or August, features new films and retrospectives by domestic and international filmmakers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Melbourne Cup, first Tuesday in November, is Australia's major annual thoroughbred horse race.&#xA0; Billed as &#x201C;The race that stops a nation,&#x201D; it is generally regarded as the most prestigious "two-mile" handicap in the world.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Japan&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Beppu:&lt;/strong&gt; Founded in 1924, Beppu is an infant in terms of Japanese cities.&#xA0; It gained attention for thousands of hot springs that occur naturally in the area. The volume of hot water generated is second only to Yellowstone in the U.S. Beppu&#x2019;s nine major geothermal hot spots are sometimes called the &#x201C;nine hells of Beppu.&#x201D;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Hakone &amp;amp; Mt. Fuji:&lt;/strong&gt; Hakone is in Fuji Hakone Izu National Park; and is known as a hot-springs resort area. The city is home to excellent museums &#x2013; Hakone Open Air Museum, Narukawa Art Museum for modern Japanese works, Pola Museum of Art and Venetian Glass Museum. Hakone features entertaining ways to view the area such as the Hakone Ropeway Glide, the world&#x2019;s second-longest cable car; and on the scenic Hakone Tozan Railway. Boats cruise on the serenely beautiful Lake Ashinoko. Mt. Fuji, at 3,776 meters/12,388 feet, is the highest in Japan. The summit has been thought sacred since time immemorial. The first ascent is thought to have been in 663 by an anonymous monk. The first foreigner to scale the summit was Sir Rutherford Alcock in 1860. Access was forbidden to women until the mid 19th century. An estimated 200,000 people climb it annually.&#xA0; Paragliding is also popular.&#xA0; At the base are Fuji&#x2019;s Five Lakes and Kitaguchi-Hongu Fuji-Sengen-jinja Shrine. The forest at the base of the mountain is rich in tales of demons, ghosts and goblins in the forest.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kyoto &amp;amp; Nara: &lt;/strong&gt;Kyoto was the center of politics and culture for more than a millennium.&#xA0; The seat of government moved from Kyoto to Tokyo in the mid-19th century. With 2,000 religious sites, 1,600 Buddhist temples, 400 Shinto shrines, palaces and gardens, it is one of the best preserved cities in Japan. Kiyomizu-dera, a superb wooden temple, and Nijo Castle are among the city&#x2019;s 17 historic UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Sites.&#xA0; Kyoto offers opportunities to delve into Japanese traditions such as the famous tea ceremony, the art of Kimono wearing, Japanese flower arranging, the arts of origami and calligraphy, dance or cooking. &#xA0;In 710, Nara became the capital, and many of its temples and shrines date from that time. &#xA0;Todai-ji Temple has the world&#x2019;s largest Buddha statue.&#xA0; Made of copper and gold, it is enshrined in the world&#x2019;s largest wooden structure.&#xA0; Horyu-ji Temple, from the early seventh century, is believed to be the oldest Buddhist temple in Japan.&#xA0; Nara Park is home to indigenous deer once revered as envoys of the gods.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Okinawa: &lt;/strong&gt;Okinawa is one of Japan&#x2019;s southern prefectures, and consists of hundreds of the Ryukyu Islands in a chain over 620 miles long.&#xA0; The capital, Naha, is in the southern region of the largest and most populous island, Okinawa Island. &#xA0;Okinawan culture was influenced by various trading partners, including Chinese, Thai and Austronesian. &#xA0;Okinawa&#x2019;s most famous cultural export is perhaps karate, probably due to the close ties with China. &#xA0;As a small kingdom, Okinawa prospered in the region, developing its own unique history and culture.&#xA0; The Ryukyu language developed separately from the rest of Japan over 1,500 years.&#xA0; Museums include Himeyuri Peace Prayer and Memorial Museum, Ishikawa City History and Folklore Museum, Nakagusuku Castle Museum, and several craft and cultural centers.&#xA0; Islanders are known for their artistic works in ceramics, textiles and glass.&#xA0; It also boasts a lively music scene, wonderful beaches and old world markets.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Sapporo: &lt;/strong&gt;Sapporo is the fourth largest city in Japan by population.&#xA0; It is best known outside Japan for hosting the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first ever held in Asia. &#xA0;It is famous for the annual Sapporo Snow Festival, which draws more than two million tourists from around the world. &#xA0;It is also noted for its exclusive white chocolate biscuits.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Takayama &amp;amp; Kanazawa: &lt;/strong&gt;Both Takayama and Kanazawa are fascinating examples of Japan&#x2019;s castle towns, which developed around the castles of feudal lords. &#xA0;Few of those original structures remain, but towns such as Takayama have managed to preserve some of its architectural legacy and medieval atmosphere.&#xA0; Many structures remain from the 1600s when the city thrived as a town of merchants.&#xA0; In old town, some of the shops, coffee houses and sake breweries have been in business for centuries. &#xA0;Hida-Kokubunji Temple has a three-story pagoda that stands beside a ginkgo tree that is more than 1,200 years old.&#xA0; Ankokuji Temple dates from 1408. Kusakabe Folklore Museum was originally one of the early 19th century merchant&#x2019;s homes.&#xA0; It was the first of several houses designated as national cultural treasures. Kanazawa was ruled by one family for 300 years, and has some 70 temples. Its rainy, temperate climate encourages agricultural production of rice, sake and sweets. &#xA0;The Japanese love of gardening can be seen in the Kenroku-en, one of the three most famous gardens in Japan.&#xA0; Beginning in 1676, it took about 170 years to construct this massive landscape. &#xA0;The Japan Alps, Hakusan National Park and Noto Peninsula National Park edge Kanazawa, and two rivers add to the relaxed feel of the city.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Tokyo: &lt;/strong&gt;Japan&#x2019;s capital, with more than 12 million people, is among the most populous cities in the world. It is the political and economical heart of Japan as well as a major player on the world stage. Tokyo was already a small fishing village named Edo, when Edo Castle was built in 1457. In 1590, the first shogun made the town his base and the center of his national military government. By the 1700s, Tokyo was home to more than one million, making it one of the largest cities in the world. It suffered two devastating events: Kanto Earthquake of 1923, and bombing in the WWII. Tokyo, however, reemerged stronger each time. The well-known area of Ginza is speckled with international designer shops while Akihabara is a busy retail area crammed with electronic stores. Tokyo Tower Observatory offers sweeping panoramas of the city. Asakusa neighborhood is noted for its many temples, particularly Sens ji. Asakusa Kannon Temple is said to be Tokyo&#x2019;s oldest temple, dating back to 628 A.D.&#xD;

	&lt;li&gt;Sapporo Winter Festival is the most famous winter festival in Japan and attracts thousands of international visitors. &#xA0;It is held in early February, and lasts about a week.&#xA0; More than 300 intricate ice sculptures and snow statues are exhibited in three sites in Sapporo, Hokkaido.&#xA0; At night, the sculptures are illuminated, creating an amazing wonderland.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Golden Week, from the end of April through around May 5, gained its name because many national holidays take place during this period.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About India, Nepal &amp;amp; Sri Lanka Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;India &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Agra&lt;/strong&gt;: Begun in 1633, it took some 20,000 workers laboring 17 years to complete the fabled Taj Mahal, a monument of glistening marble and semi precious stones.&#xA0; This is one of three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Agra. Sunrise or sunset at the monument is one of the iconic experiences of India. Another of India&#x2019;s great architectural sights is the 16th-century Agra Fort, an elegant synthesis of Hindu and Central Asian styles.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Delhi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; India&#x2019;s national capital is the eighth most populous metropolis in the world. &#xA0;It has been continuously inhabited since sixth century BC.&#xA0; Delhi is a vibrant city of teeming bazaars, British-designed boulevards and powerful Mughal palaces and forts.&#xA0; The many faces of India&#x2019;s capital are mirrored in its modern business centers, colonial architecture, and in Old Delhi&#x2019;s winding lanes.&#xA0; Rickshaws weave through throngs of shoppers and vendors clustered around Chandni Chowk.&#xA0; Mughal history comes alive at Red Fort, the ancient Qutub Minar and Humayun&#x2019;s Tomb, the earliest of the great Mughal garden tombs. &#xA0;India&#x2019;s largest mosque, Jama Masjid, is the principal mosque of Old Delhi.&#xA0; Commissioned by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, builder of the Taj Mahal, in the year 1650, it is the largest and best-known mosque in India. Embassy District&#x2019;s parliament houses, the presidential palace and Connaught Place date from the British colonial era.&#xA0; Raj Ghat is a poignant memorial to Mahatma Gandhi.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Eastern India&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Kolkata is a city of sharp contradictions and a powerful mix of East and West. &#xA0;Its architecture blends European and Mughal.&#xA0; The Indian Museum, built in 1875, ranks among the finest in Asia, and the botanical gardens, circa 1786, are home to a 200-year-old Banyan tree, said to be the largest in the world.&#xA0; Bhubaneswar&#x2019;s history traces back to the second century BC. &#xA0;It has been called the Temple City of India.&#xA0; It is also home to about 105 engineering colleges, and a center for commerce. &#xA0;Puri is on the Bay of Bengal south of Bhubaneswar and is a holy city for Hindus. &#xA0;According to Hindu teachings, a pilgrimage to the temples of India is not complete without a journey to Puri.&#xA0; It is also a beach resort with one of the best beaches in India. It is positioned so that both sunset and sunrise can be viewed from the beach.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Gujarat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Gujarat has been one of the main centers of the Indus Valley Civilization.&#xA0; Mount Abu&#x2019;s Hindu temples include rock-carved Adhar Devi Temple and several Jain temples including Dilwara, a group of temples carved out of white marble between the 11th and 13th centuries. At 1,220 meters/4,003 feet, Mount Abu has been a popular hill station retreat for centuries.&#xA0; The largest city in Gujarat is Ahmedabad, founded in 1411 on the banks of the River Sabarmati.&#xA0; Here, the Calico Museum of Textiles has an impressive and popular collection of historic materials.&#xA0; The city was at the forefront of the Indian independence movement early in the 20th century. Mahatma Gandhi, leader of the movement, was Gujarati.&#xA0; In Bhavnagar district, Palitana is a major pilgrimage city for Jains. &#xA0;Its temples are considered the most sacred by the Jain community.&#xA0; In the hills of Shatrunjaya more than 3,000 temples were exquisitely carved in marble over a period of 900 years.&#xA0; Some 3,800 steps run from the bottom of the hill to the top.&#xA0; Ambaji is another important temple town with millions of devotees visiting annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kathmandu, Dhulikhel &amp;amp; Bhaktapur&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Kathmandu, Nepal&#x2019;s capital, is known for its central Durbar Square, which is packed with extraordinary temples and monuments.&#xA0; Outdoor enthusiasts come to Nepal seeking to explore isolated settlements, Buddhist stupas and ageless monasteries, and to encounter established societies still relatively unaffected by outside influences.&#xA0; This is also a paradise for mountain climbers, who come to hike among the highest mountains in the world.&#xA0; Dhulikhel&#x2019;s magnificent high-altitude landscapes have been called one of the finest panoramic views in the world. &#xA0;It has for centuries been an important trading center on the ancient commercial route linking Nepal to Tibet.&#xA0; Bhaktapur&#x2019;s fascinating Durbar Square is noted for its Golden Gate and extraordinary Palace of Fifty-Five Windows.&#xA0; Bhaktapur is a UNESCO World Heritage Site noted for its rich culture and temples. &#xA0;It is also known for wood, metal, stone artwork and pottery.&#xA0; Thimi, close to Bhaktapur, is the potter&#x2019;s town, where a simple medieval lifestyle is still prevalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Khajuraho, Allahabad &amp;amp; Varanasi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The powerful expression of man&#x2019;s relationship to religion is keenly felt in these cities.&#xA0; The amazing, medieval Hindu and Jain temples of Khajuraho are a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for their beautiful and erotic rock carvings.&#xA0; They are considered to be one of the &#x201C;seven wonders&#x201D; of India. &#xA0;These temples were built by the Chandela kings following the tradition of Tantric art. &#xA0;Although famed for their erotic sculptures, the temples are a celebration of all aspects of life.&#xA0; Allahabad in southeastern Uttar Pradesh was originally founded in 1526.&#xA0; Today it is home to well-recognized colleges and research institutions.&#xA0; Allahabad also plays a central role in the Hindu scriptures with a number of temples and palaces. Four times every 12 years, millions of Hindus celebrate Kumbh Mela, a colorful Hindu Pilgrimage that rotates between four locations in India, including Allahabad. It truly is a spectacle, regardless of religion.&#xA0; Varanasi is the holiest city in India, revered by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains.&#xA0; Each dawn, along the sacred Ganges, hundreds of pilgrims and worshippers gather on the riverbanks to reenact centuries-old rituals and prayers. &#xA0;They congregate along rows of stone steps, the ghats that stretch the length of the city. &#xA0;The city itself is a maze of narrow alleys, shrines and pilgrim shops.&#xA0; Varanasi is an experience not to be missed.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Nagarhole National Park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; This is one of India&#x2019;s Project Tiger reserves, established in 1999 to help protect the endangered Bengal tiger. &#xA0;It is part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. &#xA0;The park spreads over the foothills of the Western Ghats down the Brahmagiri Hills and south towards Kerala state.&#xA0; It has astonishing wildlife including large mammals such as leopards, Indian wild dogs, elephant, spotted deer, four horned antelope, wild boar, sloth bear and mongoose.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Punjab:&lt;/strong&gt; This state in northwest India forms part of the larger Punjab region. Amritsar is a holy city, home to the Harmandir Sahib, the Golden Temple. This is the most important religious place in the Sikh tradition. &#xA0;It is a beautiful complex, and always busy with pilgrims from across India.&#xA0; Amritsar&#x2019;s central walled city has narrow streets mostly developed in the 17th and 18th century. It is the land where most of the Gurus were born, and is rich with their history and spirit.&#xA0; The city lies on the main Grand Trunk Road from Delhi to Amritsar to Lahore, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Rajasthan &amp;amp; its Interior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The historic desert cities of Rajasthan include Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur and Jaisalmer. &#xA0;Jaipur, once the capital of royalty, has fascinating forts, including Amber Fort, a rose-colored walled city of Mughal courtyards, gardens, and royal apartments.&#xA0; Its bejeweled interiors reflect the sumptuous style of Mughal courts.&#xA0; It is known for blending Hindu and Rajput elements. &#xA0;The heart of City Palace is the smaller Chandra Palace with its richly decorated rooms.&#xA0; The elegant Palace of the Winds of pink sandstone once served the royal harem.&#xA0; The city has an international reputation for arts and crafts &#x2013; especially jewelry, from tribal to enameled gold pieces.&#xA0; Jodhpur is the second largest city in Rajasthan and is near the geographic center of the state.&#xA0; This remarkable medieval fortress city encircles Mehrangarh Fort, which is bounded by a wall with several gates.&#xA0; It is one of the largest in India, and is perched on a hill 122 meters/400 feet above the city.&#xA0; Its palaces display intricate carvings and sprawling courtyards.&#xA0; The fort stands as a testament to medieval art, weaponry and sumptuous living. &#xA0;Udaipur is an enchanted landscape of fairytale palaces, green hills, and exotic bazaars.&#xA0; The enormous City Palace houses masterpiece frescoes and Mughal-inspired art, and the 17th-century Jagadish Temple, built in classical Hindu style.&#xA0; A splendid and luxurious heritage property sits on an island in Lake Pichola.&#xA0; Jaisalmer was once an important caravan stop. Founded in 1156, the old city is dotted with preserved mansions and narrow lanes crowded with finely sculptured houses and temples. &#xA0;The town stands on a sandstone ridge crowned by a fort that houses a palace and several ornate Jain temples. &#xA0;These historic areas serve as access points to the less traveled regions in Rajasthan.&#xA0; For example, the city of Nagaur has impressive Nagaur Fort, with its interior palaces and temples.&#xA0; Other sites of note include Tarkeen Dargah, a sacred pilgrimage center for the Muslims, Jain temples, Cenotaph of Amar Singh Rathore, and Bansiwala Temple.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;South India &amp;amp; its Interior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The region has a rich medley of cultural, historic, religious and natural attributes.&#xA0; The human history here is among the oldest in the world, and the region is known for unique styles in dance, architecture and painting.&#xA0; Here, too, are some of the finest examples of Hindu temples of Dravidian architecture. &#xA0;It has two biosphere reserves, five national parks and several wildlife sanctuaries.&#xA0; Kerala is known for its tranquil backwaters journeys, sand beaches, pristine rain forests, and lush tea estates. The art forms such as Kathakali and Mohini Attam were perfected here. Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary was one of India&#x2019;s first tiger reserves.&#xA0; The state of Andhra Pradesh has golden beaches as well as Ettipotala waterfalls and the rich bio-diversity of Talakona.&#xA0; The Borra Caves are famous for million-year old stalactite and stalagmite formations while the Belum Caves are the second largest natural caves on the subcontinent.&#xA0; Karnataka is the sixth largest state in India, and has seen some of the most powerful empires of medieval India. Its sculptured temples, modern cities, scenic hill ranges, unexplored forests and beaches make it a popular destination. &#xA0;It encompasses 25 wildlife sanctuaries and five national parks. &#xA0;Shravanabelagola is an important Jain pilgrimage site.&#xA0; It has a monolith of Gomateshwara Bahubali, 17.38 meters/58 feet tall. &#xA0;It is said to be the world&#x2019;s largest monolithic stone statue, and was carved from a single block of rock in 981. &#xA0;Bangalore is one of Asia&#x2019;s fastest growing cities, and it is the principal cultural, commercial and industrial center of Karnataka.&#xA0; It is often described as Asia&#x2019;s Silicon Valley because of its thriving information technology industry.&#xA0; Yet, its past is still seen in Old Bangalore such as Tipu&#x2019;s Palace a mud-brick fort built in 1537. Mysore is noted for its palaces, most especially Mysore Maharaja Palace. Completed in 1912, it was built in Indo-Sacracenic style, blending Hindu, Muslim, Rajput, and Gothic styles of architecture.&#xA0; Now a museum, this is a beautiful treasure house of exquisite carvings and works of art from all over the world. &#xA0;On the outskirts of the city, Chamundi Hill is the Nandi Bull statue carved in 1659 from a single boulder. &#xA0;The temple of Chamundeshwari on top of the hill dates from the 11th century. &#xA0;Also of interest are the colorful Devaraja Fruit and Vegetable Market, Jumma Masjid Mosque and Srirangapatnam, an island fortress in the Kaveri River.&#xA0; This was the site of historic battles between the British and Tipu Sultan, the &#x201C;Tiger of Mysore.&#x201D;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Tiger Circuit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Asia&#x2019;s extraordinary royal Bengal tigers are increasingly rare in the world they once ruled.&#xA0; India has set aside &#x2018;tiger parks&#x2019; to help these superb animals survive.&#xA0; Four national parks &#x2013; Pench, Kanha, Bandhavgarh and Panna are part of the tiger circuit.&#xA0; Although the tiger is the main attraction, these parks have impressive rosters of other animals, including spotted deer, wild boar, wild dogs, sloth bear, Indian fox, wolf and jungle cat. Hundreds of bird species also thrive here such as fish eagle, plum-headed parakeet and Asian paradise flycatcher. &#xA0;Ranthambhore National Park was declared one of the Project Tiger reserves in 1973. &#xA0;Ranthambore sanctuary is one of the best places in India to see these majestic predators. &#xA0;In Gujarat, the Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is the only place in the world where the pure Asiatic lion are found.&#xA0; A recent census recorded 411 lions in the park.&#xA0; Also known as the Indian lion, it is a subspecies of lion that once ranged from the Mediterranean to the northeastern parts of the Indian subcontinent.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Nepal&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Chitwan National Park:&lt;/strong&gt; This UNESCO World Heritage Site in Nepal shelters the endangered royal Bengal tiger, rare one-horned rhinoceros and golden monitor lizard.&#xA0; This unique ecosystem is significantly valuable to the world, and to help protect it, only a small portion of the park is used for tourism. Much of the area is made up of subtropical lowlands, forest and hills.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Himalayas:&lt;/strong&gt; These fabled mountains have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia. &#xA0;The mountain range reaches across 2,736 kilometers/1,700 miles and six countries.&#xA0; In India, the incomparable landscapes of these towering mountains are complimented with tea plantations, small villages and historic Buddhist monasteries.&#xA0; Ghoom Monastery is the oldest and most famous in Darjeeling. Rishikesh is a small town in the northern state of Uttarakhand, where travelers begin treks to the Himalayan pilgrimage centers, including Haridwar, which is where the sacred Ganges River leaves the mountains and flows onto the plains.&#xA0; This is among the holiest sites of pilgrimage in India with some two million people a year coming to bathe in the river.&#xA0; At sunset, priests perform the river ceremony, chanting as pilgrims place burning candles in the river. &#xA0;The Himalayas cover three quarters of Nepal, which is home to some of the highest, remotest, most rugged mountains in the world, including the highest, Mount Everest.&#xA0; This makes Nepal a natural attraction for mountain trekkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Pokhara, Nepal:&lt;/strong&gt; Today, the modern city of Pokhara is the third largest in Nepal.&#xA0; It sits on an ancient trading route between Tibet and India.&#xA0; The old city center features old shops and warehouses in the indigenous style of architecture used by the Newari people in the Kathmandu valley. &#xA0;It is marked by striking brick work and a unique style of wood carving rarely seen outside Nepal. &#xA0;Mule caravans still come here through the Himalayas.&#xA0; Temples worth visiting in the older part of town are Bindhyabasini and Bhimsen. Elevations in the area can rise from 1,000 meters/3,280 feet to over 7,315 meters/24,000 feet in a fairly short distance.&#xA0; The region is also home to medieval ruins dating from the mid-17th century.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Anuradhapura&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; An ancient city, this was Sri Lanka's first capital city founded in the 4th Century B.C.&#xA0; Archaeological evidence dates&#xA0;back to the 10th century BC. &#xA0;This UNESCO World Heritage Site was a model of systematic planning, with some of the most complex irrigation systems of the ancient world.&#xA0;The&#xA0;Sacred Bo Tree is&#xA0;the oldest historically documented tree on earth, dating back to the year 245 BC. The Folk Museum founded in 1971, is in the sacred city close to the Archaeological Museum. &#xA0;It houses a collection of artifacts, which illustrate the rural life of the North Central Province.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Colombo&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the largest city and the commercial, industrial and cultural capital of Sri Lanka. &#xA0;Colombo was known to ancient mariners as far back as 2,000 years due to its large harbor and&#xA0;strategic position along the East-West&#xA0;sea trade routes.&#xA0;It served as the capital when Sri Lanka was ceded to the British Empire in 1815, and remained the capital city until 1978, when administrative functions were moved to neighboring Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte. The city is home to several museums including the Colombo Museum, established in 1877, National Museum of Natural History and the Galle National Museum in the oldest Dutch building of the Galle Fort, which was constructed in 1656.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Galle&lt;/strong&gt;: Galle is an ancient seaport from which King Solomon took ivory, peacocks and other valuables such as spices. Cinnamon was exported from here as early as 1400 BC. Galle had been a prominent seaport long before the island came under the rule of foreign powers.&#xA0; Persians, Arabs, Greeks, Romans, Malays, Indians and Chinese traders have been doing business through this port city for centuries.&#xA0; In 1411, the Galle Trilingual Inscription was erected in Galle to commemorate the second visit to Sri Lanka by the Chinese admiral Zheng He.&#xA0;The Dutch Fort&#xA0;is among the&#xA0;best-preserved sea forts in Southeast Asia. The Dutch and the English colonial styles of architecture are evident throughout the old neighborhoods.&#xA0;Originally established by the Portuguese in the 16th century, it reached its zenith under Dutch rule in the 18th century.&#xA0; The fort offered&#xA0;spacious housing, wide roads and all necessary facilities within its walls including an intricate sewage system that was way ahead of its time. This UNESCO &#xA0;World Heritage Site was the main port of call for ships sailing between the Orient and Europe.&#xA0; Inside the ramparts and stonewalls, magnificent buildings remain, the most absorbing of which is the 17th-century Dutch Reformed Church.&#xA0; The&#xA0;streets are dotted with colonial villas. The fort also is home to some of the island's most exclusive boutique-style accommodation in former villas restored to their colonial glory.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kandy&lt;/strong&gt;: Kandy is&#xA0;one of Sri Lanka&#x2019;s prettiest cities as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its cultural richness.&#xA0; Here, the famous Temple of Tooth (Sri Dalada Maligawa) houses a sacred relic &#x2013; one of Buddha&#x2019;s teeth, marking the city as one of the most sacred places for Buddhists. &#xA0;Other holy spots include the Gadaladeniya Temple and the Lankathilake Temple.&#xA0; Kandy&#x2019;s&#xA0;Royal Palace is a treasure trove of history with the queen&#x2019;s chambers, the quarters for concubines, the armory and council chambers. &#xA0;Kady is the second largest city in the country after Colombo. It was the last capital of the ancient kings of Sri Lanka.&#xA0;&#xA0;The city lies in an area of lush tropical tea plantations and serves as both an administrative and religious center.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Polonnaruwa&lt;/strong&gt;: The second most ancient of Sri Lanka's kingdoms, Polonnaruwa was first declared the capital city by King Vijayabahu I, who defeated the invaders in 1070.&#xA0;Today, this UNESCO World Heritage Site&#xA0;remains one of the best-planned archaeological sites in the country.&#xA0;The restoration of of an ancient irrigation reservoir to serve the needs of the surrounding agricultural region, in which rice and tobacco are grown.&#xA0; The town contains numerous temples and other Buddhist structures, most of them dating from the 12th century.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Sigiriya&lt;/strong&gt;: Sigiriya rests&#xA0;within the cultural triangle formed by Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Kandy, which includes five of the eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the country.&#xA0; The city is famous for its 200-meter/656-foot high, red stone fortress with its palace ruins. The top of the fortress is reached by a series of about 750 steps.&#xA0; It is also known for its ancient fresco paintings, which are reminiscent of the Ajanta Caves in India.&#xA0;The fortress&#xA0;was built by King Kasyapa (477&#x2013;495 CE), who&#xA0;seized power from the rightful heir. Most of the elaborate constructions on the rock summit and around it, including defensive structures, palaces, and gardens, date back to this period. The king was defeated in 495 CE, and the fortress again became a Buddhist monastery, which lasted until the 13th or 14th century. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;h4&gt;Best Time to Travel to India, Nepal &amp;amp; Sri Lanka Festivals and Special Events&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;India&#x2019;s size and varied climates make it impossible to pin down a&#xA0;single best time to visit weather-wise.&#xA0;&#xA0;In general, October to March are the most pleasant months over much&#xA0;of the country.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;In the far south, the monsoon weather makes January to September&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; pleasant; while northeastern India tends to be better between March and August.&#xA0; Mountain regions are most &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; accessible between May and September. The deserts of Rajasthan and the northwestern Indian Himalayan&#xA0;region are at their best during the monsoon.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;India has a wealth of national and regional festivals.&#xA0; In January and February, Vasanta&#xA0;Panchami is a national Hindu festival in honor of Saraswati, goddess of scholars.&#xA0; Her devotees celebrate in&#xA0;their homes, except in Bengal where images are immersed in the river.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;January 26, Republic Day is India's greatest national holiday,&#xA0;observed throughout the country.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;October and November in India is the season of Diwali, a celebration of the&#xA0;start of the Hindu New Year.&#xA0;Every city and village is turned into a fairyland with thousands of flickering oil lamps and electric lights.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;In general there are two preferred times of year to visit Nepal.&#xA0;Peak season, particularly for trekking in Nepal, is from late September to&#xA0;&#xA0;early December when the air is fresh and clear skies offer the best views&#xA0;of the mountains.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;From the end of February to mid-April in Nepal, it is warm and dry, the rhododendrons are in flower and wildlife sightings are good in&#xA0;national parks. Many people visit during thing time, although a haze&#xA0;gradually obscures the mountains from lower elevations towards the end of&#xA0;this period.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;January and February have very cold nights and a lack of heating&#xA0;except in Kathmandu&#x2019;s smattering of luxury hotels. &#xA0;But it is a good time to trek around the&#xA0;rim of Kathmandu Valley if you are properly prepared.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;In Sri Lanka, November to April is the driest season on the&#xA0;southwest coast and up in the hills. Here, some of the best beaches and&#xA0;many other places of tourist interest are located. &#xA0;This period is also considered as tourist&#xA0;season in Sri lanka.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;May to September is the best time to visit the East Coast, as it&#xA0;is dry during this period. Hence, Sri Lanka is a year-round destination-there is always a good time to visit at least some part of the&#xA0;country.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;In Sri Lanka, Esala Perahera Festival&#xA0;takes place in&#xA0;July or August in Kandy, and&#xA0;is&#xA0;a unique symbol of Sri Lanka. This&#xA0;Buddhist festival features&#xA0;lavish costumes&#xA0;and richly decorated elephants with&#xA0;fire-dances, whip-dances and&#xA0; Kandian dances.&#xA0;The festival ends with the traditional 'diya-kepeema,' and&#xA0;an elephant is paraded around the city bearing the tooth of Buddha.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>Custom United Arab Emirates &amp; Oman Tour</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About United Arab Emirates &amp;amp; Oman&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Abu Dhabi:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the capital and second largest city in the UAE.&#xA0; It is a cosmopolitan metropolis, center of politics, and home to the Emirati royal family.&#xA0; Modern Abu Dhabi traces its origins to the rise of an important tribal confederation of Bedu, the Bani Yas, in the late 18th century.&#xA0; Into the mid 20th century, the economy of Abu Dhabi was mainly sustained by camel herding, date farming, fishing, and pearl diving.&#xA0; Today, the UAE&#x2019;s large hydrocarbon wealth gives it one of the highest GDP per capita in the world, and Abu Dhabi owns the majority of these resources &#x2013; 95 percent of the oil and six percent of gas. &#xA0;One of the world&#x2019;s largest producers of oil, Abu Dhabi has actively worked to diversify its economy with tourism investments. &#xA0;The new Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is inspiring, while the sporting and auto attractions of Yas Island are enticing.&#xA0; Another of Abu Dhabi&#x2019;s main draws is the Empty Quarter and the historic Liwa Oasis.&#xA0; A visit to the Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital is a fascinating experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Ajman:&lt;/strong&gt; Located near the cities of Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain, Ajman is the smallest of the seven emirates. &#xA0;It encompasses some interesting sites. &#xA0;One of the main attractions is the long expanse of powdery white sand beach, stretching for almost 20 miles along the Persian Gulf Coast. &#xA0;Its 18th-century fort, now a museum, displays collections of old manuscripts, artifacts relating to traditional life in Ajman and old weapons.&#xA0; This port city manages to retain a certain charm the other emirates lack, mostly due to its small size. &#xA0;The section called Masfout is an important agricultural area providing much of the local produce found throughout the region.&#xA0; It is known for its colorful marble.&#xA0; Of interest are the old waterfront, dhow boat building and the archaeological site of Mowaih.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Al Ain:&lt;/strong&gt; A legendary stop for Bedu caravans en route to Oman, this oasis town has much historical significance. &#xA0;Over 4,000 years old, Al Ain sights include Al Nahyan Fort, a famous camel market, and the Al Ain National Museum. There is also a state-of-the-art go kart facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Dubai:&lt;/strong&gt; A gem of sophistication between the desert and the Arabian Gulf, Dubai has come to epitomize the very concept of luxury. &#xA0;It boasts extraordinary hotels, amazing beach resorts and entertainments that include an indoor snow skiing complex and all manner of water sports.&#xA0; There is also a strong cultural heritage found in its centuries-old neighborhoods, mosques and markets.&#xA0; Dubai is famous for its nearly endless array of shopping venues, from the most upscale boutiques to the frenetic lanes of local souqs. &#xA0;The artist colony of Bastakiya and the up-and-coming art in the industrial area of Al Quoz offer a taste of Dubai that most visitors miss.&#xA0; Other sights include the Sudanese, Yemeni, and Somali Quarters, Gold and Spice souqs, Jumeirah Mosque and the world&#x2019;s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Fujairah:&lt;/strong&gt; The only emirate located on the Gulf of Oman, Fujairah is dominated by the Hajjar Mountains and pristine beaches. &#xA0;Fujairah&#x2019;s Heritage Village depicts traditional life here.&#xA0; Fujairah Fort was the first fort built in UAE. Fujairah is also home to the oldest mosque in the UAE, built in 1446 of mud and bricks.&#xA0; Al Bidyah Mosque has four domes, unlike other similar mosques, which have between seven and twelve, and lacks a minaret. &#xA0;Almost entirely in the mountains, it has a higher than average yearly rainfall, allowing farmers to produce one crop every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Liwa Oasis &amp;amp; The Empty Quarter:&lt;/strong&gt; Also called Rub al Khali, the Empty Quarter is the largest continuous body of sand in the world.&#xA0; It spreads across UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Yemen. Nomads inhabit parts of the Empty Quarter at various times of year.&#xA0; The very northern edge of the Empty Quarter is accessible from the Liwa Oasis, a historic oasis town.&#xA0; It is possible to drive to Tal Mireb, the tallest dune in the country. Rub Al Khali is eerily beautiful.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Oman:&lt;/strong&gt; Muscat is the capital of the Sultanate of Oman, and is a good base to explore the country.&#xA0; Archaeological remains in Oman have been discovered dating back to the Stone Age and the Bronze Age, and are the oldest signs of human settlement in the area. &#xA0;Known since the early first century as an important trading port between the west and the east, Muscat was ruled by various indigenous tribes as well as foreign powers such as the Persians and the Portuguese Empire at various points in its history. &#xA0;A regional military power in the 18th century, Muscat&#x2019;s influence extended as far as East Africa and Zanzibar.&#xA0; As an important port-town in the Gulf of Oman, Muscat attracted foreign tradesmen and settlers such as the Persians, Balochs and Gujaratis. &#xA0;Oman has beaches, wadis with lush oases of palm trees, and forts and castles to explore.&#xA0; Activities include sand skiing in the desert, scuba diving, rock climbing, trekking, surfing, sailing, cave exploration, bird watching and camel races.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Ras Al Khaimah:&lt;/strong&gt; This is probably the most relaxing emirate in the country. It has a beautiful stretch of coastline as well as desert landscapes.&#xA0; Here you can set your own pace.&#xA0; Relax on the beach in the Al Hamra; or head into the desert to explore the dunes, or trek in the Hajjar Mountains.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Sharjah:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the cultural capital of the country.&#xA0; Indeed, UNESCO dubbed Sharjah &#x2018;The Cultural capital of the Arab World&#x2019; in 1998.&#xA0; It boasts some 20 museums, a popular heritage area and Al Noor Mosque, all offer a glimpse into the past. &#xA0;One of the most moving sites is an old cloak from the Kaaba, Islam&#x2019;s holiest site in Mecca, on display in the Museum of Islamic Civilization. &#xA0;The Maritime Museum shows the importance the pearl diving industry once had for the emirate.&#xA0; Al Arsah Souq has a wide array of items to shop for including old foreign currency, antiques, spices and jewelry.&#xA0; This is the third largest and most populous city in the UAE, and sits along the northern coast of the Persian Gulf on the Arabian Peninsula. &#xA0;This was once one of the wealthiest towns in this region.&#xA0; It has been inhabited for more than 5,000 years.&#xA0; This emirate is known to stamp collectors due to the large numbers of stamps issued by the Sharjah post office before the formation of the UAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Umm al-Quwain:&lt;/strong&gt; This northern emirate features a fort-cum-museum that overlooks the sea and houses artifacts and a collection of weapons.&#xA0; Traditional activities of fishing, falconry, camel racing and dhow building are still evident. &#xA0;The harbor is surrounded by old coral stone houses that display the original architecture and intricate sculptured plaster work.&#xA0; Skilled craftsmen continue to make traditional dhow boats.&#xA0; Umm Al Quwain sits where the town of Al Dour used to be. It was an important trading port from about 200 BC to 200 AD. &#xA0;In winter, camel racing can be watched in the early mornings on Thursdays and Fridays. &#xA0;Camel caravans are still a familiar site crossing the desert.&#xD;

    <tour_name>Custom Egypt Tour</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Egypt Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Abu Simbel: &lt;/strong&gt;The Abu Simbel temples are two massive rock temples in Abu Simbel in Nubia, southern Egypt.&#xA0; They are situated on the western bank of Lake Nasser southwest of Aswan.&#xA0; The complex is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the &#x201C;Nubian Monuments,&#x201D; which run from Abu Simbel to Philae.&#xA0; The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century BC.&#xA0; In a colossal undertaking, the complex was relocated in its entirety in 1968, on an artificial hill made from a domed structure above the Aswan High Dam reservoir.&#xA0; The relocation of the temples was necessary to avoid their loss during the creation of Lake Nasser.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Alexandria: &lt;/strong&gt;This ancient port city, the second largest city in Egypt, the &#x201C;Pearl of the Mediterranean,&#x201D; was the center of learning in the ancient world.&#xA0; It was once home to the legendary Bibliotheca Alexandria, an ancient library founded by a pupil of Aristotle in the fourth century BC. By the middle of the first century BC, the library is said to have contained 700,000 manuscripts on papyrus.&#xA0; Pompey&#x2019;s Pillar rests in a small park near city center.&#xA0; The largest known Roman burial site in Egypt is the Catacombs of Komel El Shokfa.&#xA0; Three tiers of tombs and chambers cut into rock date from the second century AD. Fortress of Qait Bay, on the Island of Pharos, is an impressive 15th-century stronghold that stands on the site of the Great Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Aswan:&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;Egypt&#x2019;s southernmost city has among its many sites Philae Temple, the Unfinished Obelisk, intriguing tombs, the granite quarries of the pharaohs and the famous High Dam.&#xA0; Aswan has also become a popular winter resort.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Cairo: &lt;/strong&gt;Africa&#x2019;s most populous city, Cairo was founded in 969 AD. &#xA0;The timeless and energetic city occupies the banks and islands of the Nile River in northern Egypt. &#xA0;The oldest section of the city has grown haphazardly over the centuries, creating small, crowded lanes, curio shops, old mosques and tenements. &#xA0;Using Paris as a model, western Cairo was built in the mid-19th century, with boulevards, public gardens and grand, open spaces.&#xA0; In the desert west of Giza, the ancient necropolis of Memphis encompasses the three great pyramids.&#xA0; The wealth of ancient rulers is housed in the renowned Egyptian Museum, including its fascinating collection of mummies. &#xA0;Khan el Khalili bazaar is a shopping adventure. &#xA0;Sakkara Step Pyramid is the world&#x2019;s oldest known pyramid.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Edfu:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;The Temple of Horus at Edfu is the most completely preserved. &#xA0;Built from sandstone blocks, the huge Ptolemaic temple was constructed over the site of a smaller New Kingdom temple, oriented east to west, facing towards the river. &#xA0;The later structure faces north to south and leaves the ruined remains of the older temple pylon to be seen on the east side of the first court.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Egypt Oases:&lt;/strong&gt; Dotting the Egyptian desert, each oasis shows its own unique personality. &#xA0;Bahariya Oasis, for example, is rich in wildlife. It has several small villages surrounding it and encompasses mosques, health springs and unique rock formations and rock crystals.&#xA0; Kharga Oasis has important sites such as the sixth-century Temple of Hibis, which is the finest temple from the Persian period and the best example of a Persian Period temple in Egypt.&#xA0; Also nearby is the Al-Bagawat Necropolis containing hundreds of Egyptian tombs made with traditional mud and brick as well as chapels and murals. &#xA0;Other oases include Siwa, Dakhla and Farafra.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Esna:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;The temple of Esna, which has only been partially excavated, was noted for the beauty of its site and for its architecture. &#xA0;It was built of red sandstone, and its portico had six rows of four columns each, with lotus-leaf capitals. &#xA0;Esna is also known for its lively tourist market.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Hurghada:&lt;/strong&gt; Founded in the early 20th century, this resort area on the Red Sea coast is known for water sports: sailing, windsurfing, and deep-sea fishing, glassbottom boat tours, swimming, snorkeling and diving. &#xA0;The warm waters support a variety of rare fish and coral reefs, including offshore underwater gardens. &#xA0;The town has a bazaar, museum and aquarium as well as fine resorts and restaurants.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kom Ombo:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;The Temple of Kom Ombo is an unusual double temple built during the Ptolemaic dynasty in the Egyptian town of Kom Ombo. &#xA0;The building is unique because its design meant that there were courts, halls, sanctuaries and rooms duplicated for two sets of gods. &#xA0;The southern half of the temple was dedicated to the crocodile god Sobek, and the northern part of the temple was dedicated to the falcon god Horus the Elder. &#xA0;Much of the temple has been destroyed by the Nile, earthquakes and later builders who used its stones for other projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Lake Nasser:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;The man-made lake was created as a result of the construction of the Aswan High Dam between 1958 and 1971. &#xA0;A cruise on Lake Nasser offers the opportunity to explore the ancient temples and monuments including temples of Amada, Dakka and Meharakka and Wadi El Seboua. &#xA0;The lake shelters the last colonies of Nile crocodiles, monitor lizards, gazelles, jackals, fennecs and the famous Nile Perch. &#xA0;The west bank has stretches of shoreline that shelters some of the 100 species of birds.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Luxor: &lt;/strong&gt;Luxor, ancient Thebes, was the seat of the Middle Kingdom and the site of the pharaohs&#x2019; glorious temples and tombs. &#xA0;It became a prosperous city known for its high social status and luxury.&#xA0; Ruins of the temples at Karnak and Luxor are across the Nile River from the temples and tombs of the West Bank Necropolis of the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens.&#xA0; The West Bank, the Colossi of Memnon, Queen Hatshepsut&#x2019;s Temple and the Valley of Kings, sport richly decorated edifices.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Sharm El Sheik: &lt;/strong&gt;Sharm el Sheik sits on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula on the coastal strip between the Red Sea and Mount Sinai. This is another standout resort area that features diving, snorkeling and other water sports. Ras Mohamed, once an important city for travelers heading for Mecca, became a national park in the 1980s to protect the region&#x2019;s marine and desert life. &#xA0;Foxes and gazelles were reintroduced.&#xA0; Hotels and restaurants are clustered around the center of Sharm, known as Naama Bay, with golf courses and other leisure facilities further up the coast.&#xD;

	&lt;li&gt;In Cairo, and along the Nile River Valley, the climate is hot desert, but often with high humidity due to the Nile River Valley's effects.&#xA0; Wind storms can be frequent, bringing Saharan dust into the city during the months of March and April.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;High temperatures in winter range from the 55&#xB0;F to the low 70&#xB0;Fs, while nighttime lows drop to below 40&#xB0;Fs.&#xA0; In summer, the highs often surpass 104&#xB0;F, and lows drop to about 68&#xB0;F.&#xA0; Rainfall is sparse, but sudden showers can cause flooding.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Cairo International Book Fair was first held in 1969, the annual Cairo International Book Fair is one of the biggest events of its kind in the Middle East.&#xA0; In addition to the exhibition, there is also a program of cultural events which includes lectures, seminars and special displays.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Sun Festival in Abu Simbel.&#xA0; The festivals of Abu Simbel, take place twice every year here in one of the most dazzling temples in Egypt.&#xA0; The sun slowly creeps into the inner sanctum of the greater temple at Abu Simbel, illuminating the prodigious statues of King Ramses II and the two sun gods. &#xA0;After that spectacular sight, there is festive dancing and music.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Ramadan is a Muslim holy time that takes place in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar.&#xA0; It is the month of fasting, in which participating Muslims refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, and doing anything to excess from dawn to sunset.&#xA0; The dates of Ramadan are tied to the new moon. &#xA0;If you are vacationing during this time in a Muslim region, please be sensitive to this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Israel Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Beit Shean &amp;amp; Jezreel Valley:&lt;/strong&gt; Several biblical cities are located in the valley, including Beit She&#x2019;an. The city is historically significant due to its location at the junction of the Jordan River Valley and the Jezreel Valley, which essentially granted it controlling access from the interior to the coast and from Jerusalem to the Galilee.&#xA0; Here, Israel&#x2019;s first king, Saul, and his sons died.&#xA0; Canaanite graves dating from 2000 to 1600 BC were discovered in 1926. &#xA0;The fertile valley is covered with fields of wheat, cotton, sunflowers and corn and grazing lands for sheep and cattle.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Caesarea:&lt;/strong&gt; The ancient city of Caesarea is known for its ancient ruins such as the restored Roman amphitheater and the remains of the hippodrome, which may have held up to 20,000.&#xA0; The harbor was built by the Phoenicians in the fourth century BC. &#xA0;The Byzantine street of shops is captivating, and beyond that is the Crusader city, which was once protected by stout walls and bastions surrounded by a deep moat.&#xA0; In the fortified center are the ruins of an ancient aqueduct, the Herodian Temple of Augustus and the Crusader cathedral, once a Byzantine monastic church.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Dead Sea:&lt;/strong&gt; The Dead Sea is actually a lake that is 8.6 times as salty as the ocean, making it uninhabitable for marine life.&#xA0; It is shared with Jordan, the West Bank and Israel.&#xA0; It has drawn visitors from around the Mediterranean for thousands of years.&#xA0; It served as a refuge for King David, and became one of the world&#x2019;s first health resorts for Herod the Great.&#xA0; Many believe its waters and hot springs have healing powers. &#xA0;Nearby sites include the dramatic plateau fortress of Masada, a UNESCO World Heritage Site easily reached by cable car; and the ancient caves and settlement at Qumran on the northern shores of the Dead Sea, where the famous Dead Sea Scrolls were found.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Eilat:&lt;/strong&gt; At the northern tip of the Red Sea, this is Israel&#x2019;s southernmost city and a busy port. &#xA0;It is also a popular resort. &#xA0;Its arid desert climate is moderated by its closeness to the sea. &#xA0;This is the world&#x2019;s northernmost tropical sea and has 1,000 invertebrate species and 200 varieties of soft and hard coral. Although Eilat has been inhabited since 8,000 BC, only about seven percent of the area has undergone detailed archaeological surveys, even though some 1,500 ancient sites have been identified.&#xA0; It is also a good spot to explore the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Jordan&#x2019;s fabled Petra, the 2,000-year-old, rock-carved city.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Golan Heights:&lt;/strong&gt; Golan Heights is the Gamla, Sa`ar and the Banias waterfalls. In spring, the ground is covered with wildflowers. &#xA0;Mount Hermon, 2,284 meters/7,493 feet high, is in the northernmost point of the Golan Heights.&#xA0; A cable car runs up the mountain, offering stunning scenery in the summer and skiing in the winter.&#xA0; Nimrod Fortress is a 13th-century fortress in the northern Golan Heights, built by Muslim rulers to defend against a Crusader attack.&#xA0; It is located on a steep mountain ridge with deep ravines on the sides and a trail leading downhill to Banias National Park.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Haifa:&lt;/strong&gt; A major seaport on the Mediterranean coast, Haifa is the third largest city in the country with a mixture of Jews and Arabs. &#xA0;On the slopes of Mount Carmel, Haifa&#x2019;s history dates to biblical times.&#xA0;The earliest settlement in the vicinity was a small port city dating back to the Late Bronze Age. &#xA0;Haifa was once known as a dyemaking center. &#xA0;The city has been under the control of many groups &#x2013; Arabs, Byzantines, Crusaders, Ottomans, Egyptians and British.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Jerusalem:&lt;/strong&gt; Israel&#x2019;s capital, Jerusalem sits in the Judean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the northern tip of the Dead Sea.&#xA0; Modern Jerusalem is the holiest city in Judaism; the third holiest city in Islam; and is host to a significant number of Christian sites.&#xA0; The compact old city includes Temple Mount, the Western Wall, Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque. &#xA0;The walled city has been traditionally divided into four quarters: Armenian, Christian, Jewish and Muslim.&#xA0; The wonderful market offers an array of goods such as Armenian-style decorated ceramics, beautiful strings of beads, authentic clothing, colorful wool carpets and amazing glassware.&#xA0; The promenade atop the old city walls offers great views of the entire area. Jerusalem is also known for its historically significant museums such as the Israel Museum, Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Rockefeller Archeological Museum.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Judean Hills:&lt;/strong&gt; This mountain range encompasses West and East Jerusalem, Hebron, Bethlehem and Ramallah. &#xA0;The range has karst topography, including a stalactite cave in Nahal Sorek National Park. Nahal Sorek is mentioned in the Bible&#x2019;s Book of Judges as the border between the ancient Philistines and the Tribe of Dan of the ancient Israelites. &#xA0;Known in Arabic as Wadi Surar, it is also said to be where Sampson met Delilah for the first time and where she enticed him to tell her the secret of his strength.&#xA0; The mountains form a division between the western Shephelah coastal plains and the eastern Jordan Rift Valley.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Masada:&lt;/strong&gt; Atop an isolated rock plateau overlooking the Dead Sea, Masada&#x2019;s dramatic setting is compelling as is its history.&#xA0; Travelers can hike up the Snake Path on the eastern side of the mountain, or take a cable car ride to the top.&#xA0; Due to its remoteness and arid environment, the site has remained largely untouched during the past two millennia.&#xA0; The Roman ramp still stands on the western side and can be climbed on foot. &#xA0;Many of the buildings have been restored as well as wall paintings of Herod&#x2019;s two main palaces, and Roman style bathhouses. &#xA0;The synagogue, storehouses, and houses of the Jewish rebels have also been identified and restored.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Nazareth:&lt;/strong&gt; Nazareth is the capital and largest city in the North District. Its population is primarily Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel. It was described in the New Testament as the childhood home of Jesus. That makes the city and its many Christian shrines a center for Christian pilgrimage.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Qumran:&lt;/strong&gt; This archaeological site in the West Bank is set on a dry plateau a short distance inland from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, near the Israeli settlement and kibbutz of Kalia.&#xA0; The Hellenistic period settlement remained occupied until the Romans destroyed it in about 68 AD. &#xA0;It is best known as the settlement nearest to the caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Safed:&lt;/strong&gt; In the Northern District at an elevation of 900 meters/2,953 feet, Safed is the highest city in the Galilee.&#xA0; It has warm summers and cold, often snowy, winters.&#xA0; Since the 16th century, it has been considered one of Judaism&#x2019;s four holy cities, along with Jerusalem, Hebron and Tiberias.&#xA0; It is a center of Kabbalah, Jewish mysticism.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Sea Of Galilee:&lt;/strong&gt; The sea is actually a lake, the largest freshwater lake in Israel. It has a total area of 166 square kilometers/64 square miles with a maximum depth of some 43 meters/141 feet.&#xA0; It also claims the record as the lowest freshwater lake on earth. &#xA0;The Jordan River flows through it from north to south. &#xA0;It is closely tied with the life of Jesus, who is said to have delivered his Sermon on the Mount from a hill overlooking the lake, which is also believed to be the site of his walking on water and other miracles.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Tel Aviv &amp;amp; Jaffa:&lt;/strong&gt; On the coast of the Mediterranean, the city was founded in 1909 on the outskirts of the old port city of Jaffa, which it quickly outgrew. The cities joined together in 1950, making it the second largest city in Israel. Tel Aviv&#x2019;s White City is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and features the largest concentration of modernist, Bauhaus architecture found anywhere. &#xA0;Tel Aviv with its modern port is an economic engine and the richest city in Israel, which equates to an abundance of caf&#xE9;s, restaurants and upscale shopping. &#xA0;It is also a major performing arts center. &#xA0;It is ranked as the 17th most expensive city in the world.&#xA0; &#x201C;The Tachana,&#x201D; first train station of Tel Aviv, Rabin Square, Palmach Museum and Diaspora Museum are all here.&#xA0; Jaffa features the old port and artist galleries, shops and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Tiberias:&lt;/strong&gt; On the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, Tiberias was established nearly 2,000 years ago by Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great. &#xA0;A legend states that this was built on the site of the village of Rakkat, mentioned in the Book of Joshua. &#xA0;Between the second and tenth centuries, it was the largest Jewish city in Galilee, and the political and religious hub of the Jews of Palestine. Jesus is said to have performed miracles in the district, making it an important pilgrimage site. &#xA0;It has long been recognized for its hot springs, believed to have curative powers.&#xA0; The region has many sites dating back 3,000 years.&#xD;

	&lt;li&gt;Christmas, December 25, is preceded by an impressive celebration Christmas Eve at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.&#xA0; The church is said to be built over the spot of Jesus&#x2019; birth.&#xA0; People crowd the church&#x2019;s doorways and stand on the roof to watch the dramatic annual procession of horsemen and police mounted on Arabian horses who lead the parade.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Ajlun:&lt;/strong&gt; A hilly town some 76 kilometers/47 miles northwest of Amman, it is noted for the impressive ruins of its 12th century Ajlun Castle.&#xA0; It was one of the few built to protect the country against Crusader attacks from Karak in the south and Bisan in the west.&#xA0; A major objective of the fortress was to protect the development and control of the iron mines of Ajlun. &#xA0;The original castle core had four corner towers with arrow slits in the walls.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Amman:&lt;/strong&gt; Ancient Amman, Jordan&#x2019;s capital, has a sense of timelessness about it that is seen in the profusion of gleaming white houses, kebab stalls with roasting meat and tiny caf&#xE9;s, where rich Arabian coffee is sipped in the afternoon sunshine.&#xA0; It boasts one of the largest Neolithic settlements ever discovered in the Middle East. &#xA0;Citadel hill contains early Bronze Age tombs (3300-1200 BC).&#xA0; The first settlement on record dates to the Neolithic period, around 8500 BC.&#xA0; Old Amman is filled with souks, bazaars, shops and single family dwellings.&#xA0; West Amman is less crowded and more scenic.&#xA0; It is one of the richest and most Western-oriented cities in the Middle East, and most of the upscale hotels are here.&#xA0; Amman is among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, with a fascinating history.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Aqaba:&lt;/strong&gt; Aqaba is a coastal town in the far south of Jordan. &#xA0;With its balmy winter climate and peaceful setting, Aqaba is Jordan&#x2019;s year-round aquatic playground.&#xA0; Plentiful marine life in the crystal clear waters of the Gulf of Aqaba makes diving and snorkeling among the best anywhere.&#xA0; Skiing, windsurfing and fishing are also popular.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Dana Biosphere Reserve:&lt;/strong&gt; This is among the world&#x2019;s oldest continuously inhabited areas.&#xA0; It is the largest nature reserve in Jordan, covering over 300 square kilometers/116 square miles; and encompasses the varied geology of Dana - limestone, sandstone and granite. In the east, elevations reach 1,500 meters/4,921 feet before descending through canyons and gorges to the low elevations of Wadi Araba. &#xA0;Dana is not only one of the most biologically diverse areas in the country, it is also archeologically rich with evidence of Neolithic villages, ancient copper mines, Roman aqueducts and Byzantine churches.&#xA0; The people of the Ata&#x2019;ta (or Al Atata) tribe are the native inhabitants.&#xA0; Their original settlement in the area dates back some 6,000 years.&#xA0; Archeological discoveries also suggest Palaeolithic, Egyptian, Nabataean, and Roman settlement as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Dead Sea:&lt;/strong&gt; Jordan shares this salty sea with Israel to the east and the West Bank to the west. &#xA0;The Jordan River is the only major water source flowing into the Dead Sea. &#xA0;The sea has been the source of a variety of products &#x2013; from balms for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilizers.&#xA0; People also use the salt and the minerals to create cosmetics. &#xA0;The area has luxurious resorts, trendy hotspots, health spas and hot springs.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Eastern Desert Castles:&lt;/strong&gt; The main castles east of Amman make for a memorable trek back through the Persian and Greco-Roman history of Jordan.&#xA0; Qasr Amra, Qasr Al Mushatta, Qasr Al Tuba, Qasr Al-Kharrana and Qasr Al Hallabat are well preserved and adorned with priceless mosaics and frescoes. &#xA0;In this area, you will also find Azraq, home of the famous black basalt fort that T.E. Lawrence used as one of his headquarters during the Arab Revolt. &#xA0;These desert castles are beautiful examples of early Islamic art and architecture.&#xA0; They served many purposes from caravan stations to agricultural centers to resorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Jerash:&lt;/strong&gt; North of Amman, Jerash, the Roman city of Gerasa, displays some of the finest, most extensive and well-preserved remains of the former empire to be found anywhere.&#xA0; Colonnaded streets, temples, theaters, bathhouses and the oval plaza are complemented by the superbly restored hippodrome, created on a grand scale that held up to 15,000 people.&#xA0; The Roman Army and Chariot Experience reenactment explores life thousands of years past.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kerak:&lt;/strong&gt; Kerak Castle is one of the three largest Crusader castles in the Levant, a large region of the eastern Mediterranean. &#xA0;Construction began in the 1140s. With its position east of the Dead Sea, Kerak was able to control Bedouin herders and the trade routes from Damascus to Egypt.&#xA0; It is a noted example of Crusader architecture, a mixture of European, Byzantine, and Arab designs. The most notable Crusader feature surviving is the north wall with its immense arched halls on two levels. &#xA0;These were living quarters and stables, but also served as a fighting gallery overlooking the castle approach and for shelter against missiles from siege engines.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Madaba:&lt;/strong&gt; Known as the &#x201C;City of Mosaics,&#x201D; Madaba has a history beginning in the Neolithic period.&#xA0; The town, once a Moabite border city, is cited in the Bible. &#xA0;It was ruled by both the Roman and Byzantine Empires between the second and the seventh centuries.&#xA0; The famous mosaic Map of Madaba was discovered here in 1896.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Mt. Nebo:&lt;/strong&gt; Mt. Nebo is most famous as the site where the Hebrew prophet Moses was given a view of the promised land that God was giving to the Israelites.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Petra:&lt;/strong&gt; This UNESCO World Heritage Site is renowned for its amazing rock-cut architecture, the legacy of the Nabateans, an Arab people who settled in Jordan more than 2,000 years ago.&#xA0; Petra is spectacularly set deep inside a narrow desert gorge.&#xA0; From the main entrance, visitors walk through the &#x201C;Siq,&#x201D; an immense, natural crack in the sandstone that winds between overhanging cliffs. &#xA0;Petra&#x2019;s most famous monument, the Treasury, appears dramatically at the end.&#xA0; Petra has hundreds of buildings, facades, tombs, and a first century, 3,000-seat theater.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Trekking:&lt;/strong&gt; From Wadi Mujib&#x2019;s water trails to hikes around the lost city of Petra, to the massive rock monoliths in Wadi Rum, Jordan offers multiple diverse hiking experiences for avid trekking and outdoor enthusiasts. &#xA0;The ancient castle of Ajlun also boasts some spectacular nature trails.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Wadi Rum:&lt;/strong&gt; Wadi Rum epitomizes the romance of the desert with its stunning beauty. &#xA0;Bedouin tribes live in scattered camps throughout the prehistoric valleys and towering sandstone mountains rising out of the desert sand. Climbers are attracted to Wadi Rum for its sheer granite and sandstone cliffs. Hikers enjoy its vast empty spaces, where one can still capture a sense of solitude.&#xD;

&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;h4&gt;Best Times to Travel to Jordan:&#xD;
Festivals &amp;amp; Special Events&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Jordan's climate varies dramatically. The best time to visit is spring or autumn to dodge the baking summer sun and winter&#x2019;s freezing winds. Although winter can be bitterly cold in most of the country, the Red Sea area and Aqaba are still very pleasant.&#xA0; Jordan Valley can reach 104&#xB0;F in summer, while Amman and Petra occasionally get snow in winter.&#xA0; The Plateau area is usually warm and dry, between the low 70&#xB0;Fs and high 90&#xB0;Fs.&#xA0; The desert suffers extremes of temperature: baking dry heat interspersed with freezing winds from central Asia.&#xA0; Aqaba boasts winter temperatures in mid-70&#xB0; F.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Ramadan is a month of fasting between sunrise and sunset to conform to the fourth pillar of Islam. If you are here in September &#x2013; October, please be sensitive to the fact that most of the people around you are fasting. Ramadan ends with a huge feast, Eid al-Fitr, where everyone prays together, visits friends, gives presents and celebrates.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Eid Al-Adha, held around February (though the month changes almost every year), is the other big feast of the year, and coincides with the holy Hajj&#xA0;pilgrimage to Mecca.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Amman International Theatre Festival, in April, is an annual festival and the only one in the Middle East and North Africa to be organized by an independent theater company. Performances are mainly in Arabic and English. It was first held in 1994.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Jordan International Rally, held in April, is a road race in and around the Jordan Valley and within the Rumman forests, providing challenging routes both above and below sea level.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Kenya Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Amboseli Wildlife Conservancies:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;Amboseli&#x2019;s fragile ecosystem supports a wide range of mammals, including wildebeest, buffalo, impala, Thompson&#x2019;s gazelle, lion, cheetah, elephants and rare black rhino as well as more than 420 species of birds.&#xA0; It is also home of traditional Maasai people. Private wildlife conservancies protect the land and encourage wildlife conservation as an alternative to subsistence farming.&#xA0; Migrating species from Amboseli that were previously killed or driven away from farmlands are now encouraged to make the conservancy their home.&#xA0; Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in wildlife numbers with elephants returning to make the land their own after a 20 year absence. African Wildlife Foundation helps identify critical wildlife corridors such as Kitenden Corridor, which links the Kilimanjaro Forest Reserve in Tanzania to Amboseli National Park.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Chyulu Hills:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;Chyulu Hills is a collection of ancient volcanic cones and craters.&#xA0; Breathtaking views embrace Mt. Kilimanjaro. Private conservancies insure excellent game viewing of buffalo, bushbuck, eland, elephant, leopard, warthog, wildebeest and zebra and, of course, the big cats. Game drives, walking safaris, horseback riding, hiking in the mountains and visits to traditional Maasai villages make for a classic safari experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Great Rift Valley &amp;amp; Lake Victoria: &lt;/strong&gt;The valley is bordered by escarpments both east and west. &#xA0;The floor is broken by volcanoes and encompasses a series of lakes.&#xA0; This large trough in Kenya is part of the Gregory Rift, the eastern branch of the East African Rift, which starts in Tanzania to the south and continues northward into Ethiopia.&#xA0; Lake Naivasha, at over 1,829 meters/6,000 feet, is the highest lake in the Rift Valley and one of its most beautiful. &#xA0;Fringed by papyrus, this is prime bird watching territory with more than 400 species, including 13 globally threatened species. &#xA0;Lake Nakuru National Park is best known for thousands of flamingos nesting along the shores Lake Nakuru. Lake Nakuru is one of the Rift Valley soda lakes, 1,754 meters/5,755 feet above sea level. Lake Victoria has a shoreline of some 4,828 kilometers/3,000 miles and contains more than 3,000 islands, many inhabited.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Laikipia Plateau:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;This remote part of Kenya was made famous by Kuki Gallman&#x2019;s book, I Dreamed of Africa. Laikipia&#x2019;s safari lodges are intimate, catering to a small number of guests. &#xA0;It is possible to do game walks in the company of Samburu Maasai guides, whose knowledge of local wildlife, culture and history is unmatched.&#xA0; Horseback riding on the plains of Africa with herds of zebra, giraffes or elephants is unlike any other riding experience in the world. &#xA0;This is one of the last refuges for black rhino and has the largest elephant population outside of Kenya&#x2019;s parks.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, Mt. Kenya &amp;amp; Northern Kenya Conservancies: &lt;/strong&gt;Lewa Wildlife Conservancy&#x2019;s mission is not only to protect wildlife, but to act as a catalyst for conservation across northern Kenya. &#xA0;By supporting development in the communities outside conservancy&#x2019;s boundaries, Lewa has become the leading role model for sustainable wildlife conservation throughout East Africa. From 1970 to the early 1980s, the numbers and range of black rhino in Africa declined drastically.&#xA0; In Kenya alone, the population dropped from 20,000 to less than 300 due to illegal killing for rhino horn.&#xA0; Some 620 black rhino remain in Kenya, with about 75 on the conservancy.&#xA0; Since 2000, Lewa&#x2019;s black rhino population growth rate has averaged ten percent.&#xA0; Northern Kenya Conservancies are home to elephant, leopard, bushbuck, giant forest hog, buffalo as well as ancient cycads, spectacular butterflies and wild orchids.&#xA0; The semiarid Laikipia is one of the last relatively undiscovered frontiers of wildest Africa.&#xA0; Pastoralist nomads and wildlife still live in harmony and the ecosystems are still intact. Laikipia stretches from the equator near Mt Kenya, to the edge of the Great Rift Valley. &#xA0;It is a malaria-free area with an average altitude of 1,829 meters/6,000 feet. &#xA0;Kikuyu, Turkana, Pokot, Samburu, Maasai, Ndorobo, Jamu and Kalenjin tribes inhabit the area. Lions, leopards and cheetahs stalk the savannah. It&#x2019;s a haven for elephants and hippos.&#xA0; The conservancy is renowned for wild dogs, an increasingly rare sight outside the region. Imposing Mt. Kenya is the highest in Kenya and second tallest in Africa. Its highest peak sits at 5,200 meters/17,060 feet and it is encircled by national park. &#xA0;The slopes are dressed in forest, bamboo, scrub, and alpine moorland, with rock, ice and snow at the highest elevations. &#xA0;The park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and biosphere reserve.&#xA0; One of Kenya&#x2019;s successful private conservancies, Ol Pejeta Conservancy, works to conserve the highly endangered black rhino, and is the largest black rhino sanctuary in East Africa. &#xA0;It is also home to southern white rhinos and the critically endangered northern white rhinos.&#xA0; As an integral part of the Laikipia / Samburu ecosystem, Ol Pejeta is also home to the big five and boasts a high wildlife density.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Loita Hills: &lt;/strong&gt;Loita Hills are one of Kenya&#x2019;s last remaining &#x2018;true wilderness&#x2019; areas.&#xA0; This is a place to truly enjoy the landscapes and walk with local Maasai people to gain a genuine look into their world. The area offers day and night game drives, bush walks and specialised bird watching. Travelers have the opportunity to sleep under the stars on the Masai Mara and hike deep into Masai country to areas seldom visited.&#xA0; This is where the most traditional Masai culture exists. Remote forest glades, the edge of the Great Rift Valley escarpment, stunning views of Lake Natron and sunrises over distant Kilimanjaro are all on the menu here.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Masai Mara Wildlife Conservancies: &lt;/strong&gt;The Masai Mara Game Reserve is a prized wildlife sanctuary, renowned for the ancient pageantry of the annual zebra and wildebeest migration. &#xA0;Several conservancies have been created around the Masai Mara to help protect these wildlife lands as well as developing projects that benefit the Maasai people who live in the area, making them active stakeholders in the conservancy.&#xA0; This is pristine wilderness with open savannah plains, riverine forest, springs, streams and rivers and rolling hills. Intersected by dark green veins of rich acacia woodland, this area is where some of Out of Africa was filmed. Herds of buffalo, hartebeest, impala and gazelle graze the savannas. Giraffe and elephant gather along the Mara River and pods of hippos gather in the water below. &#xA0;Here, too, is the country&#x2019;s largest predator population, with lion prides up to 20 strong. Activities available include a day trip to Lake Victoria and a brilliant hot air balloon ride (weather permitting) over the Mara. &#xA0;In addition to providing revenue from land leased from the local Maasai, conservancies also offer education, medical and employment opportunities previously unavailable to these mostly subsistence-level communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Nairobi:&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;Founded in 1899, Nairobi is one of the most prominent cities in Africa.&#xA0; Much in the city harks back to its storied past such as the home turned-museum of Isak Dinesen (Baroness von Blixen), whose writings left us a picture of Kenya at the turn of the 20th century &#x2013; a colonial world of romance, daring, struggle and triumph.&#xA0; The Giraffe Centre helps protect the endangered Rothschild giraffe found only in East Africa. &#xA0;David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is an important center for the care and protection of rescued and orphaned elephants and rhinos.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Northern Rangelands Trust: &lt;/strong&gt;Northern Rangelands Trust is a home-grown institution aimed at addressing local problems and creating long-lasting local solutions. &#xA0;It connects different interest groups with a goal of collectively developing strong community-led institutions as a foundation for investment in community development and wildlife conservation. Collectively, these conservancies are home to approximately 60,000 pastoralists of different ethnic origin, including Samburu, Rendille, Laikipiak Maasai and Meru. The long-term conservation of wildlife in Kenya&#x2019;s northern rangelands is inextricably linked to the fate of these local communities.&#xA0; The Northern Rangelands Trust encompasses over three million acres. In the Matthews Mountain Range, a 323,748-hectare/800,000-acre private conservancy was established to promote wildlife conservation and socioeconomic development through sustainable utilization of natural resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Private Conservancies: &lt;/strong&gt;Private conservancies play a vital role in maintaining habitat for wildlife. &#xA0;Millions of acres are under private ownership.&#xA0; The owners have created important conservation areas. Conservancies have developed facilities and conservation projects along with local communities, who share the revenues generated, which help health, education and enterprise initiatives to alleviate poverty.&#xA0; Each reserve offers its own activities, many of which cannot be done in national parks such as bush walks, night game drives, and horse or camel trekking. &#xA0;Some also have mountain biking and river rafting. &#xA0;The conservancies also encourage guests to meet villagers to learn something of their ancient traditions. Many are adjacent to national parks and reserves such as the Masai Mara Reserve, Samburu, Tsavo, and Amboseli National Parks to maintain vital wildlife habitats, permitting animals to move freely from one area to another. Travelers also benefit as the conservancy camps and lodges allow only limited numbers of visitors at any one time, insuring an experience no longer found in many national parks.&#xD;

&lt;h4&gt;Best Times to Travel&#xA0;to Kenya&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;Festivals &amp;amp; Special Events&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Kenya is a year-round destination, with each season offering its own distinctive rewards, but the best weather is usually July to February.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The Masai Mara comes into its own between August and October when the migration is in full swing.&#xA0; Usually by late July, the herds have begun the dangerous trek from Tanzania northwards into Kenya.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Kenya&#x2019;s biodiversity shines from March through June and September to October when flowers bloom.&#xA0; September through October is also an excellent time to catch the end of migration when animals are plentiful, but visitors are fewer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Kenya&#x2019;s peak bird-watching season lasts from October to April, while the whale shark (Earth&#x2019;s largest fish) season is February and March.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The best festival in Kenya is the Mombasa Carnival in November. Every conceivable ethnic&#xA0; and cultural group has a parade float here.&#xA0; This is a spectacular display of Kenyan culture in its entirety with plenty of stalls for shopping and dance performances.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Morocco Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Casablanca &amp;amp; Essaouira: &lt;/strong&gt;The modern city of Casablanca has evolved through generations of outsiders. Settled by Berbers in at least the seventh century BC, it was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans.&#xA0; It has also seen the likes of Merenids, Portuguese, Spanish and French before gaining independence in 1956.&#xA0; Once a Carthaginian stronghold, it is the second largest city in Africa after Cairo. It is the most liberal and progressive of the country&#x2019;s cities.&#xA0; Here, you see European influences. Protected by the trade winds, and awash with flowers, Essaouira is a charming town with a very special character due to its blue-shuttered houses.&#xA0; It enjoys a micro-climate that attracts summer visitors from the inland towns such as Marrakech.&#xA0; Many artists and musicians have settled here.&#xA0; It hosts music festivals in April and June.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Fes &amp;amp; Rabat: &lt;/strong&gt;Two of Morocco&#x2019;s four &#x201C;imperial cities&#x201D; (along with Marrakech and Meknes), both are quintessential Morocco.&#xA0; Fes is divided into three sections: &#xA0;the old walled city, new Fes, and the newest section, Ville Nouvelle, created by the French.&#xA0; Within new Fes is a mellah, a Jewish quarter, where the Jewish population was confined beginning in the 15th century, and especially in the early 19th century.&#xA0; The Medina of Fes el Bali is believed to be the largest contiguous car-free urban area in the world.&#xA0; The University of Al -Karaouine was founded in 859, making it the oldest continuously operating university in the world. &#xA0;A center of religious learning, Fes has many Islamic schools.&#xA0; The souqs, tanneries and Merinid Tombs have a mood evocative of Jerusalem 1,000 years ago. &#xA0;Rabat began with a settlement on the banks of the Oued Bou Regreg in the third century BC. Its history as a capital city dates from the 12th century.&#xA0; The medina is small but nonetheless interesting.&#xA0; The imposing royal palace is in the heart of the city and across from the king&#x2019;s personal mosque. &#xA0;The elegant Hassan Tower was begun in the late 12th century.&#xA0; Other sites include the mausoleum of King Mohammed V, Kasbah of the Oudaias and Chellah Necropolis.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Marrakech:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;Marrakech is the third largest city in Morocco, and rests near the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. &#xA0;An entire day can be spent just wandering the markets filled with everything from spices to kaftans.&#xA0; Long a crossroads of cultures, it is home to medieval craft guilds that still operate by the old ways.&#xA0; Djma&#xE2; El Fna&#xE2; Square is jammed with the street theater of acrobats, fire eaters and snake charmers.&#xA0; The new European district of Gueliz plays host to fine restaurants and shops.&#xA0; The city has museums and historic architecture, including the stunning 14th-century Ben Youssef Meders.&#xA0; The royal Saadian Tombs, Saadi Dynasty, (1578-1603), were rediscovered in 1917. &#xA0;The ornate Bahia Palace offers a glimpse of life for a 19th-century nobleman in Morocco.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Middle &amp;amp; High Atlas Mountains: &lt;/strong&gt;The Atlas Mountain Range stretches across a northwestern stretch of Africa extending about 2,500 kilometers/1,600 miles through Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Jebel Toubkal, the highest peak in North Africa. &#xA0;The area is well known to hikers, skiers and those interested in culture.&#xA0; The Berbers have played a role on the north coast of Africa for at least 5,000 years.&#xA0; The Arab invasion in the seventh century forced them to assimilate or take refuge in the nearby mountains.&#xA0; The villages are strongholds of Berber culture, preserving their music, lifestyle, spirituality and art. &#xA0;A&#xEF;t-Benhaddou is a traditional mud brick ksar, a type of fortified village.&#xA0; The ruins of this UNESCO World Heritage Site have a unique geometric arrangement of the bricks.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Rif Mountains &amp;amp; Mediterranean:&lt;/strong&gt; Surrounded by the jagged escarpments of the Rif Mountains, Tetouan was founded in the third century BC.&#xA0; Artifacts from both the Roman and the Phoenician eras have been discovered.&#xA0; The medina is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. &#xA0;The city is home to craftsmen such as weavers, jewelers, carpet makers and leather workers. &#xA0;Shop, sail, fish, swim and golf are options. Tetuan is one of the two major ports of Morocco. Charming Chefchaouen has distinctive blue-washed houses nestled on winding roads in the mountains. &#xA0;The city was founded in 1471 as a small fortress.&#xA0; The Mediterranean coast of Morocco is famous for natural harbors, ancient villages and pristine beaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Sahara Desert: &lt;/strong&gt;The Sahara is the world&#x2019;s largest desert. &#xA0;Only a small part of it is fertile, fed by underground rivers and oasis.&#xA0; The desert can be a magical experience. &#xA0;At night, the air is so clear and the stars seem close enough to reach out and touch.&#xA0; Among the desert&#x2019;s tapestry of small settlements and villages, Erfoud is a French Foreign Legion outpost that retains its roots as a trade center. &#xA0;The main souq sells olives, henna, mint and other produce.&#xA0; But the jewels of the oases are the date palm trees that stretch far into the haze of the desert. &#xA0;The village of Merzouga is the gateway to Erg Chebbi, known for giant sand dunes that reach nearly 152 meters/492 feet. &#xA0;African traders sought to reach the rich northern cities in Morocco and Europe. &#xA0;Kasbah Taourirt is a preserved old-world market.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;South Morocco: &lt;/strong&gt;Taroudannt, &#x201C;Grandmother of Marrakech,&#x201D; features a medina, souqs and the culture of the Cheleuh Berbers. It is also an important argan oil producing region.&#xA0; Tafraout is laid out on a dramatic jagged landscape of parched pink granite, pale earth, red canyons and lush green oases. &#xA0;Fortified villages alternate with almond groves and fields edged by daunting prickly pear. &#xA0;Goats climb trees here. Souss- Massa National Park on the Atlantic Coast is great for bird watching.&#xD;

&lt;h4&gt;Best Times to Travel to&#xA0;Morocco&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;Festivals &amp;amp; Special Events&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;March-June and September-November are probably the best times to visit. During winter, November-February/March, days are generally mild although temperatures at night can drop into the 40s F.; and much lower in the Atlas Mountains, which also gets snow.&#xA0; Peak tourist season is July and August, but that is also the hottest season, especially in Marrakech. &#xA0;In Fes and the southwest Moroccan desert where temperatures routinely reach 100&#x2DA;F.&#xA0; Rabat and Casablanca are somewhat better due to cooler ocean breezes.&#xA0; It rains quite a bit on the north cost.&#xA0; The south is drier but colder, especially at night.&#xA0; Rabat is hot and humid during the summer, making it uncomfortable July-September.&#xA0; Weather is unpredictable in the Atlas Mountains and depends on elevation.&#xA0; Rain is frequent in the Middle Atlas Mountains, especially November-February. &#xA0;Summers average around 72-78&#x2DA;F, with winter temperatures as low as -4&#x2DA;F.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Mawazine Festival Rhythms of the World in April each year draws musicians, artists and fans from around the world to Rabat for nine days of performances.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Kelaa of M&#x2019;Gouna (Ourzazate Province) in May is marked by numerous events such as folk-dancing, singing and handicrafts exhibitions, &#x2018;Diffa&#x2019;-banquets in tents, a parade of flower-decked floats, camel rides, and an excursion by bus from Ourzazate down the Valley of the Roses.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;National Festival of Popular Arts in Marrakech each July, is considered to be one of the oldest festivities of its kind, with folklore troupes and hundreds of artists coming together to perform.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The Festival of Fantasia, in the beginning of September in Meknes, this event offers thousands of horsemen and their mounts a chance to meet and display their skills.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Namibia Travel&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Damaraland: &lt;/strong&gt;This UNESCO World Heritage Site has thousands of rock engravings and some early paintings. &#xA0;It is home to desert-adapted elephant and rhino.&#xA0; Damaraland was a name given to the north central region of Namibia, inhabited by the Damara people.&#xA0; It, like other homelands in South West Africa, was abolished in 1989 at the start of the transition to independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Etosha National Park:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;The famous park was established in 1907, when Namibia was the German colony South West Africa. &#xA0;A vast saltpan spreads over its heart that is surrounded by grass and thorn savanna, mopane bush in the west, and dry forest in the northeast. &#xA0;In the Kunene region in the northwest, Etosha Pan dominates the park.&#xA0; The hyper-saline conditions of the pan limit the species that can permanently inhabit the pan itself. &#xA0;Usually dry, it fills with water briefly in the summer, attracting pelicans and flamingos in particular. Perennial springs serve wildlife throughout the year, including the endangered black rhino and black-faced Impala.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;The Fish River Canyon: &lt;/strong&gt;In the south, Fish River features sharply towering rock faces and steep ravines that were formed by water erosion and the shifting earth&#x2019;s crust over 500 million years ago. Fish River is the longest interior river in Namibia.&#xA0; It cuts deep into a dry, stony plateau.&#xA0; The river flows intermittently, usually flooding in late summer.&#xA0; Most of the remainder of the year, the river becomes a chain of long narrow pools with rocky beds. Part of the canyon straddles the border between South Africa and Namibia. The canyon features many popular hiking routes.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Serra Cafema:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;Set in the dry Namib Desert, Serra Cafema is one of the most remote destinations in Africa. &#xA0;In the extreme northwest of Namibia, it is reached only by air.&#xA0; A small camp overlooks the Kunene River, with just eight canvas-and-thatch chalets.&#xA0; The river is the only permanent source of water. This is one of the driest desert environments in the world. &#xA0;Oryx, springbok, ostrich and Kunene crocodiles live here.&#xA0; Ovahimba families are some of the last semi-nomadic peoples in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Skeleton Coast: &lt;/strong&gt;Near the Angola border, the Bushman named this &#x201C;The Land God Made in Anger.&#x201D; Skeleton Coast National Park is an inhospitable but hauntingly beautiful place with terrain encompassing towering canyons, giant dunes, windswept plains and saltpans.&#xA0; Freshwater springs percolate down through barren sands creating pockets that sustain desert elephant, gemsbok and brown hyena. This is also the homeland of the Himba people.&#xA0; Charter flights are recommended to explore this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Sossusvlei Dunes:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;The Namib Desert stretches from the Orange River in the south into Angola in the north.&#xA0; A dry riverbed only comes to life in years of exceptionally heavy rainfall, and provides just enough water to support the specially-adapted animals such as Oryx, jackal, springbok, ostrich, spotted hyena and several species of plants.&#xA0; During the flood season, migratory birds appear along the marshes and rivers.&#xA0; Much of the Sossusvlei and Namib fauna is highly adapted to this landscape.&#xA0; The soaring red sand dunes are the highest in the world;&#xA0; many above 200 meters/656 feet.&#xA0; The ighest one s some 380 meters/1,247 feet high.&#xD;

Festivals &amp;amp; Special Events&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The desert is very dry yet pleasant throughout the year. April-May becomes increasingly dry and largely free of dust.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;June-August, Namibia cools off and dries out. Animals in the north migrate south for water.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;By September-October, it warms up; game viewing in good in most areas, although there is often much dust. &#xA0;Summer is November-February.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Wika Carnival happens each April in Windhoek.&#xA0; The German carnival has been popular for nearly 50 years and includes cabarets and an all-night masked ball.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Celebrated throughout the country, Oktoberfest begins in September and continues into October.&#xA0;&#xA0;This is a popular annual event that attracts a great variety of both visitors and locals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Bwindi Impenetrable National Park: &lt;/strong&gt;Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in the southwest of Uganda is roughly 518 square kilometers/200 square miles of extremely dense rainforest. &#xA0;It has more than 120 species of mammals, including chimpanzee, black and white colobus, bushpig, duiker, leopard, jackal and elephant, plus 350 species of birds.&#xA0; But the stars here are the 340 Bwindi gorillas, half the world&#x2019;s population of the critically endangered mountain gorillas.&#xA0; The park is situated along the Democratic Republic of Congo border next to the Virunga National Park, and on the edge of the Albertine Rift.&#xA0; It covers 331 square kilometers/128 square miles of jungle forests and contains both montane and lowland forest. &#xA0;The park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is among the most diverse forests in East Africa, with more than 1,000 flowering plant species including 163 species of trees and 104 species of ferns.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Entebbe: &lt;/strong&gt;Entebbe sits on the northern shore of Lake Victoria, Africa&#x2019;s largest lake. &#xA0;The old colonial gardens and parks give Entebbe a relaxed atmosphere. &#xA0;The United Nations uses Entebbe as a depot and staging area for their vehicles and heavy equipment that are part of peace keeping and other missions in the central African region The National Botanical Gardens of Uganda were laid out here in 1898, and are divided into different zones, including a rainforest zone.&#xA0; A trivia note:&#xA0; This rainforest formed the backdrop to scenes from the Tarzan films featuring Johnny Weissmuller in the 1940s.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kibale National Forest: &lt;/strong&gt;Uganda&#x2019;s Kibale National Park has one of the highest diversity and concentration of primates in Africa. It is home to a large number of endangered chimpanzees, as well as the red colobus monkey.&#xA0; The park is also home to over 325 species of birds, 13 species of primates and over 250 tree species.&#xA0; The predominant ecosystem in Kibale is evergreen and semi-deciduous forest. &#xA0;Much of the forest was logged during its time as a forest reserve, and some exotic species of trees were planted in plantations (pines and eucalyptus). &#xA0;Since the national park was gazetted many of these introduced trees have been removed and logging has ended.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kigali: &lt;/strong&gt;Kigali is a gateway to Rwanda. In the heart of the country, this rapidly growing city is the national capital, but also the country&#x2019;s most important business center and main port of entry.&#xA0; Now a century old, it began in 1907 as a small colonial outpost with little connection to the outside world.&#xA0; Kigali has come of age and made major strides. &#xA0;It is a city that has not just survived, but has prevailed and has grown into a modern metropolis.&#xA0; Kigali is blessed with a moderate high altitude climate that belies its tropical location.&#xA0; The city spreads across four ridges and valleys.&#xA0; The ridges have an average elevation of 1,599 meters/5,246 feet, while the valleys are around 1,301 meters / 4,270 feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Lake Kivu: &lt;/strong&gt;Kivu is the largest of Rwanda&#x2019;s many freshwater lakes. Steep terraced hills lead down to the picturesque lakeshore, and three resort towns, Gisenyi, Kibuye and Cyangugu.&#xA0; The Rift Valley Mountains and the volcanic Virungas can be seen to the north. The lake&#x2019;s inlets, peninsulas and waterfalls provide a relaxing stop.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Lake Mburo National Park: &lt;/strong&gt;Five lakes within the park host hippos, crocodiles and a variety of waterbirds, while swamps on the fringe support sitatunga antelope and red, black and yellow papyrus gonalek.&#xA0; The park is just 260 square kilometers/100 square miles, making it one of Uganda&#x2019;s smaller national parks, but it is noted for its rich biodiversity and a variety of animals such as zebra, impala, eland, buffalo, oribi, Defassa waterbuck, leopard, hippo, hyena, topi and reedbuck as well as over 300 bird species.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Ngamba Island: &lt;/strong&gt;Ngamba Island forms part of Uganda&#x2019;s Kome Archipelago, a group of islands separated from the northern shore of Lake Victoria.&#xA0; The Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary was begun in 1998 when 19 orphaned chimpanzees were rescued from poachers. &#xA0;Ngamba was chosen because it was uninhabited rainforest that closely resembled their native habitat.&#xA0; It is accessible either by a speedboat or traditional canoe.&#xA0; It is supported by Uganda Wildlife Education Center, Born Free Foundation and Jane Goodall Institute. &#xA0;Guests may accompany juvenile chimpanzees on a walk through their forest habitat in the early morning.&#xA0; Please note that visiting here does require certain health checks for the protection of the chimpanzees.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Parc National Des Volcans:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;The park protects the montane ecosystems of evergreen and bamboo forest, grassland and swamp. Some 178 bird species are here, with at least 13 species and 16 subspecies endemic.&#xA0; Five of eight volcanoes in the Virunga Mountains are here. &#xA0;It is home to another group of gorillas.&#xA0; Hiking into this tangle of wilderness is a remarkable experience.&#xA0; The voices of the rainforest come in the form of bird calls and monkey chatter.&#xA0; An encounter with gorillas in the wild makes it easy to understand the passion of Dian Fossey, who worked to protect these magnificent creatures for 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Queen Elizabeth National Park: &lt;/strong&gt;This Ugandan park sits between Rwenzori Mountains to the east and Lake Edward to the west. Conservation efforts have restored much of the game that was being lost to poaching. Kyambura Gorge, chimps can be heard in treetops, but they are elusive and always unpredictable. The famous treeclimbing lions are in the Ishasha region of the park. Kasinga Channel contains the world&#x2019;s largest concentration of hippos.&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7650" alt="" src="http://www.bigfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/BigFiveFrog.jpg" width="90" height="90" /&gt;About Tanzania&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Mt. Kilimanjaro: &lt;/strong&gt;The "rooftop of Africa," Kilimanjaro has three volcanic cones, Kibo, Mawenzi and Shirahe. &#xA0;Hiking the famed mountain is the adventure of a lifetime for many who come here. &#xA0;At 5,895 meters/19,340 feet, Kilimanjaro is Africa&#x2019;s highest mountain.&#xA0; A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is encircled by Kilimanjaro National Park.&#xA0; Its ecosystems range from lowland forests to alpine meadows to barren rock and ice near the top. &#xA0;With planning, nearly everyone from first-timers to seasoned climbers can scale the peak.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Ngorongoro Highlands Conservation Area:&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;The conservation covers more than 13,209 square kilometers/5,100 square miles.&#xA0; The crater is the largest intact caldera, collapsed volcano, in the world.&#xA0; It has been called &#x2018;Africa&#x2019;s Eden.&#x2019; Indeed, most of East Africa&#x2019;s common species are found here. The descent of about 609 meters/2,000 feet into the crater passes through rainforest and thick vegetation before emerging onto the grassy plains of the crater floor.&#xA0; This UNESCO World Heritage Site is part of the Serengeti ecosystem.&#xA0; It protects black rhinos, hippos, zebra, wildebeest, eland and lion.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Olduvai Gorge:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;Between the Ngorongoro Crater and the Serengeti is Olduvai Gorge.&#xA0; In the 1950s, the Leakey family made the first of many discoveries of hominoid remains of a skeleton dating back 1.8 million years. They unearthed three distinct hominoid species and a series of footprints estimated at 3.7 million years old.&#xA0; This is one of the oldest sites of hominoid habitation yet discovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Serengeti National Park:&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;The Serengeti ecosystem in northwestern Tanzania extends into southwestern Kenya.&#xA0; The vast plains bear witness to the largest and longest overland migration in the world. Upwards of 1.5 million wildebeest, zebra, and various antelope travel in a great circular migration from the Serengeti to the Masai Mara and back again; &#xA0;traveling over 2,897 kilometers/1,800 miles each year in search of rain-ripened grass. &#xA0;The region comprises several national parks and game reserves that protect some 70 species of large mammals and 500 species of birds.&#xA0; Serengeti National Park is widely regarded as the best wildlife national park in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Southern Tanzania: &lt;/strong&gt;Southern Tanzania includes some of the country&#x2019;s most remote and pristine parks, including Mikumi National Park, rich in birds and big game;&#xA0; Uzungwa Mountain National Park, dubbed the African Galapagos for the range of endemic plants and animals; &#xA0;and Katavi National Park, another scarcely traveled treasure.&#xA0; Selous Game Reserve is one Africa&#x2019;s largest protected wildlife reserves, covering five percent of Tanzania. &#xA0;Dense wilderness mixed with open plains provide habitat for elephant, which some sources estimate at 65,000, black rhino, cheetah, giraffe, crocodile and hippos.&#xA0; Its remoteness makes this sanctuary untouched &#x2013; old Africa, far from paved roads and souvenir shops.&#xA0; Boating and hiking safaris are possible here. Mahale Mountains National Park is set deep in the heart of the African interior, inaccessible by road, and is home to some of Africa&#x2019;s last remaining wild chimpanzees: a population of roughly 800.&#xA0; The forest supports many animals including bushbucks, bushpigs and an incredible array of birds and butterflies. It&#x2019;s also inhabited by nine species of primate.&#xA0; Activities include forest walks, trekking to see chimpanzees, kayaking, swimming, fishing and sailing.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Tarangire National Park &amp;amp; Lake Manyara National Park: &lt;/strong&gt;The park is home to great herds of elephant. &#xA0;During the dry season, up to 300 individuals can be found along the dry river bed, digging for underground streams, while migratory wildebeest, zebra, buffalo, impala, gazelle, hartebeest and eland flock to the remaining pools.&#xA0; The swamps support 550 bird varieties. Tarangire is part of the northern circuit that includes Ngorongoro and Serengeti. &#xA0;Lake Manyara National Park, on the edge of the Rift Valley, encompasses forests, bush plains, cliffs and hot springs.&#xA0; The alkaline soda of the lake attracts huge numbers of birds such as yellow-billed stork, African grey hornbill and blue-naped moosebird. &#xA0;In addition to hippo, blue monkey, leopard and lion, it has the largest groups of baboons found anywhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Wildlife Conservancies:&lt;/strong&gt; Private conservancies work to establish a healthy balance between people and nature.&#xA0; They protect critical habitats, including vital wildlife corridors to allow the natural movement of animal populations. They offer opportunities previously unavailable to local communities through employment, education and health care initiatives. &#xA0;Each conservancy tailors its goals and programs according to the needs of its location.&#xA0; One such pioneering conservation effort is the result of cooperation and support from both the African Wildlife Foundation and the Tanzania Land Conservation Trust that is successfully protecting a critical wildlife corridor between Tarangire and Manyara national parks in Northern Tanzania. &#xA0;Guests have access to one of &#xA0;the region&#x2019;s most prolific game areas, and gain a look at a new approach to conservation using the private conservancy model.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Zanzibar: &lt;/strong&gt;Three islands, Unguja, Pemba and Mafia, plus smaller islands make up the Zanzibar Archipelago in the Indian Ocean.&#xA0; The capital is Zanzibar City on Unguja.&#xA0; The old Stone Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that has changed little in 200 years. &#xA0;Its labyrinth of narrow streets, bazaars and mosques are fascinating.&#xA0; Old Arab houses are known for intricately carved doors, of which there are some 500 examples.&#xA0; Zanzibar invites travelers for a relaxing break with more than 25 beaches.&#xD;

&lt;h4&gt;Best Times to Travel to Tanzania&#xD;
Festivals &amp;amp; Special Events&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Tanzania is a year-round destination where each season has something to offer.&#xA0; &#x201C;Short Rains&#x201D; season is November and December while the &#x201C;Long Rains&#x201D; are March through May.&#xA0; Summer runs from December to March; winter from March to May.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The prime months for climbing Mount Kilimanjaro are August to October and January to March.&#xA0; Several marathon challenges centered around Mt. Kili take place February through June.&#xA0; The original Mt Kilimanjaro Marathon is held on the last Sunday in June every year.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The calving season takes place on the Serengeti between January and mid-March before the Wildebeest Migration begins in late May.&#xA0; The best time to see the migration is usually between June and July when the wildebeest and zebra congregate to cross the famous Grumeti River.&#xA0; Between December and January, the animals gradually begin their migration back to the Serengeti.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Sauti za Busara (Songs of Wisdom in Kswahilli) is an internationally renowned music festival in Zanzibar&#x2019;s Stone Town each February.&#xA0;&#xA0;Concerts feature traditional music from Swahili taraab and ngoma to more contemporary genres that mix African, Arab and Asian traditions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Other events include the Zanzibar International Film Festival in June; Dar es Salaam Goat Races in August; and the TANZACAT Catamaran Regatta - All Africa Hobie Championships in September.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7650" alt="" src="http://www.bigfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/BigFiveFrog.jpg" width="90" height="90" /&gt;About Zambia&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;amp; Zimbabwe&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kafue National Park: &lt;/strong&gt;Kafue is Zambia&#x2019;s oldest park, and, by far, the largest. &#xA0;It is the second largest national park in Africa. Despite the park&#x2019;s proximity to both Lusaka and the Copperbelt, it has remained underdeveloped until recent years.&#xA0; It offers a raw and diverse slice of African wilderness with excellent game viewing, bird watching and fishing opportunities. &#xA0;Large prides of lion, solitary leopards and cheetahs are the prime predators.&#xA0; A host of smaller carnivores include side striped jackal, civet, genet and mongoose. &#xA0;Bird watching, especially on the rivers, is superb.&#xA0; Over 400 species of birds have been recorded throughout the park.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Livingstone &amp;amp; Mosi-oa-Tunya (Victoria Falls):&lt;/strong&gt; Victoria Falls is shared between Zambia and Zimbabwe.&#xA0; The mile-wide, 360-feet-high falls form the largest sheet of falling water in the world.&#xA0; Vapors, &#x2018;smoke,&#x2019; can be seen from great distances. &#xA0;The falls and the river can be experienced in a variety of styles:&#xA0; on a casual sunset cruise, whitewater rafting the Zambezi, a walking tour, and on delightful helicopter and micro-light flights. &#xA0;The truly daring can try parachuting or making the world&#x2019;s longest bungee jump, 364 feet, from Victoria Falls Bridge. &#xA0;Elephant-back safaris are possible here.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Lower Zambezi National Park:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;This national park sits on the Zambian side of the Zambezi River, downstream from Lake Kariba.&#xA0; Across the river is Zimbabwe&#x2019;s Mana Pools National Park.&#xA0; Lower Zambezi Park covers an area of 4,092 square kilometers/1,580 square miles. &#xA0;From the Zambezi Escarpment, the land sweep down to the river. &#xA0;At the edge of the river is a floodplain where most of the animals are found. &#xA0;Behind the floodplain grasslands is a picturesque wooded escarpment.&#xA0; Large herds of elephant, some numbering 100, gather at river&#x2019;s edge.&#xA0; &#x2018;Island hopping&#x2019; buffalo and waterbuck are also quite common.&#xA0; Lion, leopard, spotted hyena, serval, specklethroated otter, jackal, and rare African wild dog live here. &#xA0;Game viewing is on foot, in open vehicles, by motorboat and, most characteristically, by canoe, enabling the visitor to glide silently among animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Lusaka: &lt;/strong&gt;Lusaka is the capital and largest city in Zambia, and one of the fastest growing cities in Africa.&#xA0; It is home to several fine museums including the Lusaka National Museum, the Political Museum, and the Zintu Community Museum. &#xA0;The city also supports the Moore Pottery Factory, Lusaka Playhouse Theater, Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Lusaka Central Sports Club, and the zoo and botanical gardens of the Munda Wanga Environmental Park.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;South Luangwa National Park:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;This is the finest game park in Zambia. Along the Luangwa Valley at the southern tip of the Great Rift Valley it encompasses the Luangwa River basin. &#xA0;The park is adjacent to highlands and a mosaic of varied habitats extending outwards from the brooding Luangwa River.&#xA0; It meanders through the luxuriant valley, supporting thousands of hippo and crocodile.&#xA0; South Luangwa has one of the greatest game concentrations in Africa.&#xA0; Elephant, a wide variety of antelope, buffalo, kudu, zebra, Thornycroft&#x2019;s giraffe and wildebeest occur in great numbers, as does some 400 bird species. &#xA0;Lion, wild dog and hyena are also common and the park is famed for its excellent leopard sightings.&#xA0; The South Luangwa experience differs with the seasons:&#xA0; in the dry winter months from June to September, small seasonal safari camps are set up in glorious seclusion.&#xA0; The more sophisticated lodges, close to the main gate at Mfuwe Bridge, remain open longer.&#xA0; The camps occupy prime sites on ancient oxbow lakes, amidst shady ebony groves, and offer day and night game drives in open vehicles. Walking safaris were pioneered in Luangwa and it still sets the standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Zimbabwe National Parks: &lt;/strong&gt;Hwange is Zimbabwe&#x2019;s largest national park and premier game viewing area.&#xA0; The park holds the largest variety of animals and over 400 species of birds including elephant, giraffe, zebra, buffalo, hyena, lion, leopard, cheetah and a variety of antelope such as Sable, Kudu and Impala. &#xA0;Large concentrations of game congregate around the water holes, particularly large herds of elephant.&#xA0; Mana Pools National Park was established in 1963.&#xA0; It lies along Zimbabwe&#x2019;s northern border on the banks of the Zambezi River, downstream and northeast of Lake Kariba.&#xA0; Mana Pools is ranked as one of Africa&#x2019;s outstanding wildlife reserves and during the winter months it has the highest concentration of game in the entire continent.&#xA0; Huge herds of elephant and buffalo are drawn to the sweet Zambezi waters, followed by Lion, Hyena, Kudu, Nyala, Impala and a multitude of game.&#xA0; Several of Zimbabwe&#x2019;s national parks remain wild and remote while at the same time, more luxury tented camps and lodges are being sustainably developed along classic lines for a genuine safari experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;h4&gt;Best Times to Go to &lt;strong&gt;Zamibia &amp;amp; Zimbabwe&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Festivals &amp;amp; Special Events&lt;/h4&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Zambia has three seasons.&#xA0; December-April:&#xA0; warm and wet.&#xA0; May - August: dry and sunny with cold nights. September - November: hot and dry.&#xA0; Average temperatures in summer range from 77&#xB0;F to 95&#xB0;F, and in winter from 42&#xB0;F to 75&#xB0;F.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;November-April is the rainiest; most bush camps close as dirt roads are impassable.&#xA0; They reopen in May-June when the roads have dried out. This begins the peak season with increasing numbers of animals returning.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;From September onward, it becomes increasingly hot with warm evenings.&#xA0; October should be avoided as far as walking safaris are concerned.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Lusaka Music Festival is usually the fourth Saturday in June. &#xA0;Some 20,000 people attend the free festival to hear the musical heritage of many tribes and see dance performances related to social rituals such as marriage and birth.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Christmas is celebrated with parties, gift giving, family get-togethers and more between December 25th to January1st.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bumthang: &lt;/strong&gt;Bumthang&#x2019;s temples such as the seventh-century Jampa Lhakhang temple&#xA0; and historic monasteries seemed to have slipped through time untouched.&#xA0; The valley&#xA0; is home to some unique cottage industries such as Red Panda Brewery and Bumthang Cheese/Dairy Facility. Wangdichhoeling Palace is the home of the second king&#xA0;of Bhutan.&#xA0; Kurjey Lhakhang is considered one of Bhutan&#x2019;s most auspicious monuments and is where early winter festivals are held, drawing thousands of Bhutanese to receive blessings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eastern Himalayas&lt;/strong&gt;: This region is situated in several countries with Bhutan on its southern slopes. Steep, high mountains are crisscrossed by a network of rivers and deep valleys. Elevation rises from 200 meters/660 feet in the southern foothills to more than 7,000 meters/23,000 feet.&#xA0; This great geographical diversity combined with equally diverse climate conditions contributes to Bhutan&#x2019;s outstanding range of&#xA0;biodiversity and ecosystems.&#xA0; More than 770 species of birds and 5,400 species of plants&#xA0;occur throughout the kingdom; and Bhutan has are species such as the golden langur.&#xA0; This biodiversity hotspot has some 234 globally outstanding eco-regions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paro&lt;/strong&gt;: Paro is home to many of Bhutan&#x2019;s oldest temples and monasteries and the country&#x2019;s only airport. Kurjey Monastery (Tiger&#x2019;s Nest) is a place of pilgrimage for&#xA0; Bhutanese. Legend claims that Guru Padmasambava, wizard-saint of Himalayan Buddhism, came here in the eighth century, riding his flying tiger to a cave to meditate.&#xA0; There he left a stone imprint of his body.&#xA0; Later, a temple was carved into the cliff about 800 meters/2,624 feet above the valley in his honor.&#xA0; Those who hike up to the caf&#xE9; opposite the monastery are rewarded with breathtaking views.&#xA0; On the north end of the valley stands the ruins of Drukgyel Dzong (Victorious Fortress), where Bhutanese repelled invading Tibetan armies in the 17th century. The National Museum, housed&#xA0; in the Ta Dzong, offers a wonderful introduction to the rich culture and heritage of the kingdom.&#xA0;&#xA0;Just a short walk downhill lays the dominating Paro Dzong, a fine&#xA0; example of Bhutanese architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phobjika&lt;/strong&gt;: A beautiful wide, flat valley without trees, Phobjika welcomes visiting&#xA0; black-necked cranes that arrive from Tibet each winter.&#xA0; They come in large numbers to a protected area in the valley.&#xA0; On arrival, they are said to circle the 17th-century Gangtey&#xA0;Monastery three times, and repeat this ritual when they return to Tibet in early spring.&#xA0; The monastery is devoted to Nyingmapa, the oldest of the four major schools of Tibetan&#xA0;Buddhism. &#xA0;A monastic college has been established above the village.&#xA0; The valley lies on the periphery of the Black Mountain National Park.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Punakha&lt;/strong&gt;: Punakha was Bhutan&#x2019;s capital until the government was moved to Thimphu. The valley is famous for farming red and white rice along the river valley of Pho and Mo Chu, two of the most prominent rivers in Bhutan.&#xA0; Built in 1637-38, the striking red and&#xA0; white Punakha Dzong was the site of the coronation of the first king of Bhutan.&#xA0; Since the 1680s, a special chamber in the dzong has been the site of a continuous vigil over the earthly body of the founder of Bhutan.&#xA0; At 1,350 meters/4,430 feet, Punakha, which dates from 1637, once served as the winter capital.&#xA0; It is still the winter home to Bhutan&#x2019;s spiritual leader and the monks of Thimphu and Paro.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thimpu&lt;/strong&gt;: Thimphu Valley has supported small settlements for centuries and a dzong has existed there since 1216.&#xA0; But not until the king made Thimphu Bhutan&#x2019;s new capital in the 1960s did the city begin to develop with vehicles appearing the following year for the first time.&#xA0; The town&#x2019;s School of Thangka painting, National Library, and Traditional Medicine Institute all offer fascinating insights into Bhutan and Buddhist philosophies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trekking&lt;/strong&gt;: Trekking journeys in the Himalayas are an adventure for the experienced enthusiast. Big Five offers a variety of programs for those who wish to&#xA0; hike these mountains.&#xA0; In Bhutan, a six-day journey begins at Jele Dzong, at an altitude of 2,591 meters/8,500 feet, and climbs up to about 3,353 meters/11,000 feet at Lake Jimilangtso.&#xA0; The terrain is varied and breathtaking.&#xA0; Walks average four to seven miles a day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trongsa&lt;/strong&gt;: Trongsa is one of Bhutan&#x2019;s most historic towns.&#xA0; The first monastery was built here in 1543.&#xA0; The town&#x2019;s dzong was constructed in 1644, and served as the original seat of power of the House of Wangchuck before it became the ruling dynasty of Bhutan in 1907.&#xA0; The dzong is a massive structure with many levels, sloping down the contours of the ridge on which it is built. Because of the dzong&#x2019;s highly strategic position on the only connecting route between east and west, the governor of the region was able to control the whole of the central and eastern sections of the country from here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Temperatures in the far south range from 15&#xB0;C/59&#xB0;F in winter (December to February) to 30&#xB0;C/86&#xB0;F in summer (June to August).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;In Paro the range is from -5&#xB0;C/23&#xB0;F in January to 30&#xB0;C/86&#xB0;F in July.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;In the high mountain regions the average temperature is 0&#xB0;C/32&#xB0;F in winter and may reach 10&#xB0;C/50&#xB0;F in summer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>Custom Cambodia &amp; Laos Tour</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Cambodia &amp;amp; Laos Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Battambang:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;Founded in the 11th century by the Khmer Empire, Cambodia&#x2019;s Battambang is known as the leading rice-producing province of the country.&#xA0; For over 500 years, it was the main commercial center of Siam&#x2019;s Eastern Provinces, though it was always populated by Khmer with a mix of ethnic Vietnamese, Lao, Thai and Chinese. &#xA0;Today it is a bustling provincial capital in western Cambodia on the banks of the Sangker River. &#xA0;It connects the region with Phnom Penh and Thailand. The city has some of the best preserved French Colonial architecture in the country.&#xA0; It also has the Battambang Museum and Wat Piphit temple. Outside the city north of the Cobra Bridge are the ruins of Ek Phnom, built during the Bayon period.&#xA0; Sadly, much of the temple has fallen down and been heavily looted. &#xA0;Wat Ek Phnom shows remnants of a once impressive temple.&#xA0; It sits next to a large pond behind a modern Buddha statue.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Koh Ker:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;Briefly the capital of the Khmer empire between 928 and 944, Koh Ker is an amazing temple site that is dominated by Prasat Thom, a 30-meter/98-foot tall temple mountain raising high above the plain and the surrounding forest. &#xA0;Beng Mealea is a 12th-century temple that was enclosed by a large moat. &#xA0;Almost lost to time and jungle, the site was being reclaimed by giant tree roots clinging temples and walls. &#xA0;The site is slowly being reclaimed. &#xA0;Now, it is recognized for its wealth of classical bas reliefs.&#xA0; The Koh Ker site is dominated by Prasat Thom, a temple mountain raising high above the plain.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Mekong River, Pakbeng &amp;amp; Huay Xai: &lt;/strong&gt;Riverboat cruising explores the Mekong River, the 7th longest in Asia, and the lifeblood of the region. About 80% of the protein intake of Cambodians is from fish. River cruising along the Mekong can include sailing from Saigon to My Tho, some 70 kilometers / 43 miles to the south. Cai Be has a colorful floating market. Local sampans come from all provinces of the delta to sell fruits and vegetables. Along the river, scenes of daily life are carried out on the islands of the Mekong River. Pakbeng is a small village on the river that is a major stopover for boats traveling from Luang Prabang to Huay Xai. Several hill tribes are nearby. Huay Xai lies on the river opposite Chiang Khong in Thailand.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Northern Laos:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;The towns and provinces of northern Laos, including Oudomxai, Phongsali, Muang Khua, Nong Khiaw, offer travelers the increasingly uncommon opportunity to engage with a quickly vanishing way of life. &#xA0;Distinctive traditional cultures of the hill tribe minority villages include Ban Song Cha, Ban Luang Cheng, Na Sao, Na La, and Muang Ngo.&#xA0; For now, these people cling to their generations-old traditions.&#xA0; Ou River comes out of the Chinese frontier, and flows south and southwest through the gorges and mountain valleys of the northernmost part of Laos before joining the Mekong near Luang Prabang. &#xA0;At the confluence of the two rivers, the well-known Pak Ou caves are home to thousands of Buddha statues.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Phnom Penh: &lt;/strong&gt;This is said to be one of the prettiest of the French-built cities of Indochina. Cambodia&#x2019;s capital city sits at the union of three rivers: Mekong, Bassac and Tonle Sap. Its broad boulevards, old colonial buildings and parks are a tranquil contrast to the energy of the historic city center with its labyrinth of narrow lanes, markets, food stalls and shops. The royal palace compound includes Chan Chhaya Pavilion for dance performances; the king&#x2019;s official residence; and the spectacular Silver Pagoda with its exquisite floor covered with 5,000 individually crafted silver tiles. Independence Monument was built in 1958 to commemorate Cambodia&#x2019;s autonomy from France. Tuol Sleng Museum (Museum of Genocide) was a school until the 1970s when the Khmer Rouge turned it into a notorious prison. Over 17,000 people were taken from here to the extermination camp at one of many Killing Fields. A period of reconstruction was spurred by the continuing stability of government that led to new foreign investment.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Siem Reap: &lt;/strong&gt;Siem Reap province is located in northwest Cambodia.&#xA0; It is a major tourist hub due to its proximity to the remarkable, world-famous temple city of Angkor.&#xA0; Long thought to be a myth, Angkor was rediscovered by Henri Mahout in 1860. The fortified city of Angkor Thom covers an area of ten square kilometer/3.8 square miles. Enclosed by a wall and wide moats, the city includes many of Angkor&#x2019;s popular sights: the famous south gate, Terrace of the Elephants and the Terrace of the Leper Kings. &#xA0;Bayon Temple features galleries of delicate bas reliefs.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Vientiane &amp;amp; Luang Prabang: &lt;/strong&gt;Vientiane is the capital of Laos.&#xA0; It is peaceful compared to other Asian capitals.&#xA0; Like all of Laos&#x2019; major cities, it spreads out along the banks of Mekong River.&#xA0; Its population, roughly 450,000, accounts for about ten percent of country&#x2019;s total.&#xA0; The flavor of French Colonialism is strong.&#xA0; Dated colonial buildings nudge up to gilded temples, and a French bakery sits amid shops selling noodle soup. &#xA0;The city&#x2019;s most famous landmark is That Luang (Royal Stupa), constructed in 1566 and restored in 1935.&#xA0; Wat Xieng Khouang, outside the city, is known for its huge structures that combine Buddhist and Hindu philosophies.&#xA0; Wat Sisaket features over 6,800 Buddha images.&#xA0; The temple dates back to 1818, but it is the oldest surviving temple in Vientiane.&#xA0; The Revolutionary Museum displays art and artifacts from the Lao People&#x2019;s Revolution. &#xA0;On a small peninsula surrounded by mountains, Luang Prabang seems cocooned in time. In 1353, the first Lao Kingdom was formed here at the junction of the Mekong and the Khan rivers. &#xA0;It became the capital and royal residence until the 16th century, when the capital was moved to Vientiane. &#xA0;Luang Prabang architecture blends traditional Buddhist and European styles in its many temples, stupas, monasteries and palaces.&#xA0; Every morning, hundreds of monks from the monasteries walk through the streets collecting alms.&#xA0; At a forest camp outside the city, an elephant encounter explores the lives of Asian elephants, allowing visitors to spend time with these intelligent, gentle animals.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Song Saa Island: &lt;/strong&gt;Cambodia&#x2019;s charming islands sit in the warm waters of the Gulf of Thailand. Most remain undeveloped, deserted oases of virgin rainforests, tropical reefs and glistening white beaches. Song Saa Island is a beautiful, untouched paradise of old-growth rainforest and clear coral reefs with Cambodia&#x2019;s first luxury private island resort.&#xD;

	&lt;li&gt;Water Festival, October/November, is a Cambodian national celebration that heralds the end of the rainy season, the start of fishing season, and a unique natural phenomenon:&#xA0; the flow of Tonle Sap River changes direction! &#xA0;Boat races, fireworks and a flotilla of decorated dugout canoes mark the festival&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Angkor Festival, November or December, is a showcase of performing arts with Angkor Wat as an incomparable backdrop. &#xA0;Performers from all over Asia tell epic stories from myths, using their own national costumes and musical interpretations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The week-long That Luang Festival in Vientiane, Laos, in November, is a colorful festival of fairs, contests, fireworks, processions and music.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>Custom China Including Tibet Tour</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About China Including Tibet&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beijing:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;This mammoth city has uncounted stories to tell. &#xA0;The mythical Forbidden City is the largest imperial palace complex in the world, and has 9,999 rooms &#x2013; one room short of the number that ancient Chinese believed represented &#x2018;Divine Perfection.&#x2019; For 500 years, the palace was the administrative center and the residence of emperors and empresses of Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties.&#xA0; Also on an imposing scale, Tiananmen Square is said to be able to hold one million people.&#xA0; The Great Wall snakes through five provinces, a distance of 4,163 kilometers/2,587 miles.&#xA0; Beijing&#x2019;s historic temples include the 16th-century Temple of Heaven, Temple of Confucius, Great Bell Temple, Niujie (Ox Street) Mosque and Yonghe monastery.&#xA0; The Summer Palace is a classic garden of serene beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guilin &amp;amp; Xian: &lt;/strong&gt;Guilin has long been renowned for its unique setting surrounded by hills.&#xA0; A short cruise from Guilin to Yangshuo travels through countryside layered with folk tales and legends, past valleys, bamboo groves and limestone pinnacles.&#xA0; Jingjiang Princes&#x2019; City is a famous walled city within Guilin, dating from the Ming Dynasty. &#xA0;It once served as an &#x2018;inner city&#x2019; occupied by the princes and their families. &#xA0;The area has fascinating formations such as Seven Star Cave, Reed-Flute Cave, Camel Mountain and Elephant Trunk Hill.&#xA0; Xian, the capital for 11 dynasties, exemplifies the extraordinary continuity of Chinese civilization.&#xA0; The phenomenal Terra Cotta Warriors were discovered here. &#xA0;Life-size warriors guarded the tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, first emperor of the Qin Dynasty (246-209 BC).&#xA0; More than 7,000 soldiers, horses, chariots and weapons have been unearthed at this UNESCO World Heritage Site. &#xA0;Here, too, is the Banpo Village Remains, a settlement typical of the Neolithic Yangshao culture.&#xA0; Archaeologists have discovered nearly 10,000 tools, 45 houses, 200 cellars, pottery kilns and burial sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hong Kong: &lt;/strong&gt;Hong Kong&#x2019;s story is unique in all of China. &#xA0;It is as western as it is Asian.&#xA0; Under British control for more than 150 years, it was returned to China in 1997.&#xA0; Hong Kong is one of two special administrative regions that operate under the &#x201C;one country, two systems&#x201D; policy.&#xA0; The Chinese government is responsible for the territory&#x2019;s defense and foreign affairs, while Hong Kong maintains its own legal system, police force, monetary system and customs and immigration policies.&#xA0; Hong Kong emerged as a leading financial center in the late 20th century. &#xA0;It is an intriguing city, including the New Territories and Macau.&#xA0; Victoria Peak, reached by a tram, offers panoramic views of the magnificent harbor.&#xA0; Ocean Park is one of top theme parks and aquariums in Southeast Asia. &#xA0;Aberdeen Harbor is home to hundreds of trawlers on which generations of fishermen and their families have lived. From the Hong Kong Disneyland to the traditional Po Lin Monastery and Big Buddha to high-fashion shops, Hong Kong is a destination of delightful eccentricities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shanghai &amp;amp; Water Towns Of Tthe Grand Canal: &lt;/strong&gt;Shanghai is a modern international metropolis that is never motionless as it strives to balance its rich heritage with its future dreams.&#xA0; The Bund on the waterfront is a mix of building styles from Art Deco to ultra-modern. &#xA0;Nanjing Road&#x2019;s 600 or so shops draw shoppers from around the globe. &#xA0;Shanghai Museum houses art, pottery and paintings. &#xA0;Jade Buddha Temple features white jade Buddhas imported from Burma in the 19th century.&#xA0; Jin Mao Tower in the finance district in Pudong is the world&#x2019;s third tallest building.&#xA0; In this area, the fabled Yangtze River begins to thin and spread its fingers, stretching them into tributaries. &#xA0;Jiangnan means &#x201C;South of the Yangtze,&#x201D; and usually refers to the area between Shanghai and its two neighboring provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.&#xA0; The longest canal in the world today is China&#x2019;s ancient Grand Canal. Begun in 605, it is 1,794 kilometers/1,115 miles long, and was originally built to carry the Emperor Yang Guang between Beijing and Hangzhou.&#xA0; Along the way, the ancient canal system intermingled with natural rivers and lakes. Much of the canal is not functioning today, but the canal in Jiangnan is still heavily trafficked. &#xA0;A collection of ancient water towns are sprinkled along the way such as Zhouzhuang, Luzhi, and Tongli near Suzhou, and Xitang and Wuzhen near Hangzhou, each with its own personality. &#xA0;These towns recall images of lovely Chinese silk paintings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shanxi Province: &lt;/strong&gt;The province is called the coal belt because of the number of coal mines located within this province.&#xA0; In Datong, Yungang Grottos encompass a series of 53 Chinese Buddhist temple grottoes, dating from 460-494.&#xA0; Taiyuan is known for its phenomenal hanging temples that are some 1,400 years old, and seem to hang impossibly from the cliffs.&#xA0; During the Qing Dynasty, Pingyao was a financial center in China. &#xA0;Its history stretches back over some 2,700 years.&#xA0; It is one of the best-preserved ancient cities in the known world.&#xA0; A UNESCO World Heritage, the city has preserved Ming- and Qing-style residences that number close to 4,000. &#xA0;The streets and storefronts largely retain their historical appearance. &#xA0;In 1986, China designated Pingyao as one of the Chinese Historic and Cultural Cities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silk Road:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;Extending 6,500 kilometers/4,000 miles, the Silk Road began in the Han Dynasty (206 BC &#x2013; 220 AD).&#xA0; Trade along this route was a major factor in the growth of the civilizations of China, India, Persia and Arabia.&#xA0; Stations became towns, then cities such as Kashgar.&#xA0; The last station in China, Kashgar is noted for the Abakh Hoja Tomb, Id Kah Mosque and its famous Sunday Bazaar, where thousands come every Sunday to trade and sell everything from goats to garments.&#xA0; Gaochang was built in the first century BC, and became an important trading center.&#xA0; It was destroyed during the 14th century and its ruins are just southeast of modern Turpan.&#xA0; The city of Kuche (Kuqa) was another early stop.&#xA0; An ancient Buddhist kingdom ran along the northern edge of the Taklamakan Desert.&#xA0; It became the center of the later Uyghur Kingdom. &#xA0;In Kuche, the Tang Dynasty Thousand Buddha Cave has stone carvings dedicated to Buddhism. &#xA0;By the third century, this was a major center for Buddhism.&#xA0; The statues in Kuche have a different appearance than those in Turpan and Dunhuang. &#xA0;Here, the statues appear more Asian or European.&#xA0; In Turpan, the carvings look more like the Uyghur people while in Dunhuang, the look is Chinese. &#xA0;Kucha&#x2019;s 112 surviving cave temples date from the fifth century to the time they were abandoned in the 11th century. &#xA0;This site is not open to the public.&#xA0; Big Five has arranged for private VIP access. The city of Gaochang was the old Uyghur village of Tuyuk.&#xA0; Other sights in the region include the red sandstone hills of the Flaming Mountains, Bezeklik Buddhist Caves and the town-fortress of Jiao He with its local bazaar. Dunhuang skirts the Taklamakan Desert, and two branches of the Silk Road met here the final leg to China&#x2019;s capital.&#xA0; A number of Buddhist cave sites are located in the Dunhuang area, the most important of these are the Mogao Caves, which are located 25 km southwest of Dunhuang. &#xA0;There are 735 caves in Mogao, and the caves in Mogao are particularly noted for their Buddhist art as well as the hoard of manuscripts, the Dunhuang manuscripts, found hidden in a sealed-up cave. &#xA0;It is also known for its 492 Mogao Grottoes began back in the fourth century.&#xA0; This phenomenal site features about 44,995 square kilometers/17,373 square miles of frescos, 2,415 painted statues, paintings, and about 50,000 Buddhist scriptures, textiles and historic documents. &#xA0;The murals and stucco sculptures were created over a span of nearly a thousand years.&#xA0; Big Five has also arranged for a special VIP visit to two of the caves closed to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tibet:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;At an average elevation of 4,877 meters / 16,000 feet, Tibet&#x2019;s first ruler was Songts&#xE4;n Gampo, about 604 &#x2013; 650 BC, who united and ruled Tibet as a kingdom. The country has preserved its ancient palaces, rich religious history, temples and monasteries. Potala Palace, originally built in the seventh century, was rebuilt in 1645, and is noted for grand buildings, complex constructions and spiritual atmosphere. Jokhang Temple in the center of old Lhasa, built in the mid-seventh century, has a four-story temple with superb golden roofs. Tibet&#x2019;s mountains, lakes and rivers are ideal for biking, trekking, rafting and climbing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yangshuo, Longsheng, Kunming &amp;amp; Lijiang:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;This region is known for its extravagant scenery of jagged mountains, lovely rivers and charming towns. The Li River winds through Yangshuo, a small town that can be explored on foot or by bicycle.&#xA0; The road to Longsheng passes by the dramatic &#x2018;Dragon&#x2019;s Backbone&#x2019; rice terraces, where farmers have grown rice the same way since the 13th century. &#xA0;Here, too, are several Chinese ethnic minorities such as Zhuang, Miao, Yao and Dong. &#xA0;Kunming is a political, economic and cultural center.&#xA0; Its old city, once walled, coexists with modern commercial districts, astronomical observatory and universities.&#xA0; About 121 kilometers/75 miles from Kunming is Yunnan Stone Forest, a fantasy forest of karst formations covering more than 2,985 hectares/115 square miles.&#xA0; More than 200 million years old, thousands of limestone rock peaks, pillars, and stalagmites rise abruptly out of the earth. &#xA0;Lijiang is a thriving city, home to more than a million people.&#xA0; Its most endearing feature is Old Town. In and around Lijiang ethnic minorities developed, including the Dongba and the Naxi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Arthur&#x2019;s Pass:&lt;/strong&gt; In the heart of New Zealand&#x2019;s South Island, Arthur&#x2019;s Pass climbs to more than 900 meters/2,953 feet, making it the highest pass across the Southern Alps. &#xA0;It is surrounded by Arthur&#x2019;s Pass National Park. &#xA0;A wide range of adventure activities includes hiking, canoeing, kayaking, wildlife treks and much more.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Auckland:&lt;/strong&gt; The largest city in New Zealand, it is both cosmopolitan and relaxed.&#xA0;Howick Historical Village reflects life as it was in the mid-1800s. National Maritime Museum, Parnell Colonial Village and Rose Gardens are interesting as well as Town Hall. &#xA0;Great shopping and dining make the city a delicious way to begin any New Zealand adventure.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Bay Of Islands:&lt;/strong&gt; The North Island&#x2019;s Bay of Islands is regarded as the birthplace of modern New Zealand, since it was here that European settlement first began in 1814. &#xA0;Ninety Mile Beach (actually 88 kilometers/55 miles) runs west of Kaitaia towards Cape Reinga along the Aupouri Peninsula.&#xA0; Cape Brett&#x2019;s 1908 lighthouse sees the majestic display of the Tasman Sea clashing with the Pacific Ocean.&#xA0; According to Maori legend, the cape is where the spirits of the dead enter the underworld.&#xA0; The area offers some of the best deep-sea and big game fishing in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Christchurch:&lt;/strong&gt; The Maori may have inhabited this area over a millennium go.&#xA0; In 1840, the first Europeans settled on the plains and Christchurch became a city by Royal Charter in 1856.&#xA0; Today, Christchurch, the garden city, is known for its festivals that encompass arts, hot-air ballooning and flowers. It also boasts fine restaurants, galleries, gardens and shops.&#xA0; The unique International Antarctic Centre is the only attraction where you can experience an Antarctic storm, first hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Glenorchy:&lt;/strong&gt; During the gold rush of the 1860s, miners came to the area seeking their fortunes. Remnants of several mines still exist. But today&#x2019;s travelers come here for the dramatic landscapes and the vast number of adventure activities. &#xA0;Scenic helicopter flights provide a birds-eye view of this breathtaking alpine countryside. &#xA0;Hiking is done along renowned trails such as the Milford Track, often described as &#x201C;the finest walk in the world.&#x201D; Horseback riding, mountain biking, heli-skiing in winter and kayaking are popular as well as jet boats on the Dart River.&#xA0; Fishing in wild and untouched rivers offers outstanding fly-fishing.&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Homesteads Of New Zealand:&lt;/strong&gt; New Zealand excels at being exceptional. Among its many assets are a range of extraordinary homesteads that are nothing short of brilliant. &#xA0;Less than a dozen of these meet Big Five&#x2019;s sustainability standards.&#xA0; They share a profound respect for the land, local culture and their reputations for excellence. &#xA0;Yet each has its own distinctive character.&#xA0; One began as a successful farming operation in the mid-1800s; another is an elegant island retreat accommodating just seven guests; and yet another is ideally located at the edge of a national park. They offer rewarding glimpses of life in New Zealand.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kaikoura:&lt;/strong&gt; Once a center for the whaling industry, it offers some of the best whale watching in the world.&#xA0; A variety of species can be seen offshore along with pods of dusky dolphins. &#xA0;There is also a large colony of Southern fur seals at the edge of the town.&#xA0; Bird watchers may catch sight of albatross, petrel and shearwater.&#xA0; The Seaward Kaikoura Mountains is a branch of the Southern Alps that reaches down to the sea. &#xA0;Hiking trails wind through this scenic setting.&#xA0; The area has been inhabited by Maori for 1,000 years, and provides for one of the best Maori cultural tours.&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Marlborough Sounds:&lt;/strong&gt; The region appears in stories and legends of the indigenous Maori.&#xA0; The famous Captain James Cook favored Marlborough Sounds as a base while charting New Zealand in the 18th century. Marlborough is known for its mussel farms.&#xA0; With forests, trout-filled rivers, rugged backcountry and sheltered bays, it is a favorite for outdoor enthusiasts. &#xA0;There are opportunities for sailing, diving, biking, kayaking and hiking.&#xA0; More leisurely pursuits include vineyard tours and browsing galleries and craft studios.&#xA0; Wildlife includes dolphin, seal and blue penguin.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Milford And Doubtful Sound (Te Anau):&lt;/strong&gt; The region has achieved UNESCO World Heritage status for its famous landscapes, including Mitre Peak, Milford and Doubtful Sounds and Mount Aspiring National Parks. Doubtful Sound possesses a sheltered serenity that contrasts with Milford Sound.&#xA0; New Zealand fur seal and Fiordland crested penguin inhabit many small islets.&#xA0; Doubtful Sound is also the deepest fiord, with several outstanding waterfalls. &#xA0;It can be explored by kayak, on a cruise, as a day trip or overnight. The hub of the fiord region is the attractive town of Te Anau, nestled on the edge of a lake, with a backdrop of Mt. Luxmore and the Murchison Mountain.&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Nelson &amp;amp; Abel Tasman National Park:&lt;/strong&gt; Sitting at the top northwest corner of South Island, Nelson encompasses superb beaches, unscathed forests and rugged mountains.&#xA0; More than 350 contemporary, traditional and Maori working artists and craftspeople have studios here. &#xA0;The Inland region is notable for its cave systems, and country&#x2019;s deepest vertical shaft, Harwood&#x2019;s Hole.&#xA0; Te Waikoropupu Springs holds the world record for fresh water clarity. Abel Tasman National Park was founded in 1942. &#xA0;The Tonga Island Marine Reserve adjoins part of the park.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Queenstown:&lt;/strong&gt; Born during the 1860s gold rush era as a mining camp, Queenstown retains an element of that frontier energy.&#xA0; This is the place for adventure sports &#x2013; bungee jumping, skiing, snowboarding, white-water rafting, sky diving, hot-air ballooning, hang gliding and mountain biking as well as golf, biking, walking, sailing and fishing.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Rotorua:&lt;/strong&gt; Rotorua is the remarkable &#x201C;Thermal City.&#x201D; Te Puia Thermal Reserve and Whakarewarewa Thermal Reserves have boiling mud pools and active geysers.&#xA0; In the area, working farms showcase the talents of working sheep dogs and the variety of sheep that contribute to New Zealand&#x2019;s worldwide reputation for fine wool products.&#xA0; The Waitomo Glow Worm Caves are a stunning underground wonderland, magically lit by glow worms.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Southern Alps (Franz Josef/Greymouth):&lt;/strong&gt; Haast Pass is the entryway to World Heritage Westland National Park with its dramatic mountain ranges, native forests and lakes.&#xA0; Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers offer rewarding adventures such as optional scenic flights over, or guided walks on one of the glaciers.&#xA0; Greymouth is home to the Tranz Alpine Train, which travels through beech forests and past the village of Arthur&#x2019;s Pass before crossing the Southern Alps.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Taupo:&lt;/strong&gt; The town sits on the shore of Lake Taupo, New Zealand&#x2019;s largest lake and a trout fishery with stocks of introduced brown and rainbow trout. &#xA0;It is a center of volcanic and geothermal activity and hot springs. &#xA0;The lake was created nearly 2,000 years ago by a volcanic eruption that darkened the skies over Europe and China.&#xA0; The Craters of the Moon has a fascinating geology with geysers, steaming craters and boiling mud pools.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Wellington:&lt;/strong&gt; New Zealand&#x2019;s capital city is set on the edge of a peaceful harbor surrounded by rolling hills.&#xA0; It is an amiable city with boutique shops, galleries and great restaurants within easy walking distance of downtown. &#xA0;The city on the North Island is bounded on three sides by water. &#xA0;In 1839, the first Europeans settled here.&#xA0; As the nation&#x2019;s capital, Wellington has a rich cultural life that includes Royal New Zealand Ballet, Te Whaea National Dance and Drama Centre and National Portrait Gallery.&#xD;

    <tour_name>Khuisiin Naiman Nuur Natural Reserve &amp; Gobi Desert </tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;MONGOLIA: THE PRIVATE COLLECTION&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Discover Mongolia&#x2019;s fascinating 17th-century capital city, Ulaanbaatar&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Travel into the mythic Gobi Desert, the third largest desert in the world and home to the famous Flaming Cliffs and the Singing Sands&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Explore the volcanic &#x201C;Eight Lakes&#x201D; in the Khuisiin Naiman Nuur Natural Reserve&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Visit the 17th century monasteries of Gandan, Amarbayasgalant and Erdene Zuu&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Investigate&#xA0;Havtsgait Valley's&#xA0;ancient rock drawings left by early Gobi settlers&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: &#xA0;Arrive Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
The contrast between ancient traditions and the dawning of a 21st -century democracy is most visible in Ulaanbaatar, where traditional gers and Buddhist monasteries coexist with modern high-rises.&#xA0; Upon arrival at the airport, you are welcomed by your bilingual guide and transferred to your comfortable, centrally located hotel, which is within walking distance of museums and shops.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Blue Sky Tower (D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: &#xA0;Ulaanbaatar&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Begin the day with a visit to Gandan Monastery, the seat of Buddhism in Mongolia.&#xA0; Woven through Mongolia&#x2019;s nomadic culture is a rich Tibetan-Buddhist tradition in which ancient shamanist practices are still evident.&#xA0; Although Buddhist monasteries were either destroyed or converted into museums during the Stalinist purges of the 1930s, Gandan Monastery continued to operate as a showpiece for government officials.&#xA0; In spite of the government&#x2019;s efforts to suppress Buddhism and other religious beliefs, Mongolia&#x2019;s spirituality persisted and a significant resurgence of Buddhism began in 1990 when Mongolia became a democracy.&#xA0; Monasteries across the country are again opening their doors to worshippers, and the few lamas who survived the purges are training a new generation.&#xA0; Massive reconstruction and renovation projects are underway and priceless artifacts that were hidden for safekeeping are now being returned to monasteries by nomadic families.&#xA0; For photographers, we can arrange a private photo shoot in one of the temples.&#xA0; A visit with one of the high ranking lamas in a private audience can also be arranged in advance.&#xA0; Travel back in time with a visit to the dinosaur halls of the Natural History Museum, showcasing spectacular fossils found in the Gobi desert.&#xA0; On display are fierce Tarbosaurous fossils (closely related to Tyrannosaurus Rex), dinosaur eggs, large Hadrosaur fossils (duck-billed dinosaurs), and many others, all of which illustrate the richness and importance of the paleontological sites in the Gobi desert.&#xA0; Also, you enjoy behind-the-scene access to the paleontological lab, where local scientists prepare recently discovered fossils.&#xA0; After lunch, drive through downtown Ulaanbaatar to the National History Museum for an excellent overview of Mongolia&#x2019;s history and culture.&#xA0; The newly remodeled museum displays traditional implements of daily nomadic life including Stone and Bronze Age artifacts, historic costumes of Mongolia&#x2019;s minority tribes, sacred religious relics, and agricultural, fishing and hunting equipment.&#xA0; This evening, savor a performance featuring traditional Mongolian dancers and hoomi (throat) singers followed by a welcome dinner.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Blue Sky Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: &#xA0;Ulaanbaatar / Amarbayasgalant Monastery / Kharakhorum&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, fly by private helicopter or plane to Amarbayasgalant Monastery, established in the 17th century by a Manchurian emperor.&#xA0; The monastery is noted as one of the few surviving examples of traditional Mongolian architecture and construction.&#xA0; All of the construction materials used to build the monastery are local.&#xA0; Set in an idyllic valley, this beautiful monastery was partially destroyed in the Communist purges of the 1930s.&#xA0; The renovation of the main temples was completed three years ago.&#xA0; Next, fly to Kharakhorum, site of the 13th-century capital of the Mongol Empire.&#xA0; It is impossible to mention Mongolia without conjuring up images of the great warrior Genghis Khan.&#xA0; The empire created by Chinggis (Genghis) Khan and his descendants was the largest contiguous land empire in recorded history, and its scope has never been matched.&#xA0; The great Khan and his son created the beautiful and legendary Kharakhorum to serve as the heart of this monolithic empire.&#xA0; There are only a few traces left of this once-great city, but Mongolia&#x2019;s largest monastery, neighboring Erdene Zuu, was reputedly constructed from the ruins of Kharakhorum in the 16th century.&#xA0; Surrounded by 108 stupas, Erdene Zuu has been a place of Buddhist activity for more than 500 years.&#xA0; Explore the monastery grounds and observe the monks as they perform their prayers and rituals.&#xA0; Next, visit Shankh Hiid, a monastery within short driving distance from Erdene Zuu and Kharakhorum.&#xA0; Also under renovation, Shankh Hiid was once frequented by the renowned Buddhist artist and sculptor Zanabazar.&#xA0; Tonight, you spend the night in a ger, the traditional felt tent of nomadic herders.&#xA0; Made of a latticed wood structure, it is covered with layers of felt and canvas.&#xA0; Each ger is heated by a wood stove and furnished with beautifully painted wood-framed beds.&#xA0; The camp restaurant and western-style toilet and shower facilities are located in a central building a few hundred feet from the gers. &#xA0;The gers provide an authentic and memorable taste of Mongolian culture, and allow you to visit areas which otherwise lack traveler accommodations. &#xA0;Most visitors find their stays at ger camps to be among their most enjoyable experiences in Mongolia.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ger Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Kharakhorum / Khuisiin Naiman Nuur Natural Reserve&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, discover Erdenezuu Monastery and the newly built local history museum.&#xA0; Then, fly on to Khuisiin Naiman Nuur Natural Reserve, the 11,500-hectare region that encompasses a series of interconnected lakes known as &#x201C;Eight Lakes&#x201D; in the Central Mongolian Khangai mountain range.&#xA0; Volcanic in origin, this wildly scenic area is the result of massive volcanic eruptions thousands of years ago.&#xA0; Explore this wilderness on guided nature walks.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ger Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Khuisiin Naiman Nuur Natural Reserve&#xA0;/ Gobi Desert&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Spend the morning exploring the stunning lakeshore and surrounding mountains on nature hikes or enjoy the opportunity to kayak in this dramatic setting.&#xA0; Next, fly by private helicopter or plane to the legendary Gobi Desert.&#xA0; Enjoy a welcome dinner at your award-winning lodge.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Three Camel Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6: &#xA0;Gobi Desert - Yol Valley National Park&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today travel to Yol Valley National Park, cradled in the foothills of the Altai Mountains.&#xA0; An ancient river carved this surprisingly green valley, and its remnant streams create ice formations at the base of the valley that persist as late as July.&#xA0; Hike through the valley to the habitat of indigenous vulture-like Lammergeiers, Altai snowcocks, ibex, yaks, and Argali mountain sheep.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Three Camel Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Gobi Desert - Moltsog Els - Flaming Cliffs&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After a leisurely breakfast, you travel to Moltsog Els, one of the few regions of the Gobi with sand dunes.&#xA0; Explore the area on foot.&#xA0; Or, learn the basics of riding a camel with help of local camel wranglers, and discover the area on camelback.&#xA0; Continue to the legendary Flaming Cliffs of the Gobi, named for the red-orange sandstone that glows brilliantly at sunrise and sunset.&#xA0; Here in 1923, Dr. Roy Chapman Andrews and his exploration team from the American Museum of Natural History found the first nest of dinosaur eggs the world had ever seen.&#xA0; To the trained eye, the ancient formations of the Flaming Cliffs are rich with fossils.&#xA0; Paleontological expeditions continue to make significant discoveries at this site.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Three Camel Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; Gobi Desert &#x2013; Havsgait Valley / Ulaanbaatar&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning drive to Havtsgait Valley to see ancient rock drawings left by early Gobi settlers.&#xA0; Explore these striking petroglyphs before returning to the lodge.&#xA0; In the afternoon, fly to Ulaanbaatar and upon arrival transfer to the hotel.&#xA0;&#xA0;This evening, enjoy a farewell dinner.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Three Camel Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; Ulaanbaatar / Depart&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, transfer to the airport for departure. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

	&lt;li&gt;Visit Gorkhi Terelj National Park, completely wild except for a tiny southern portion that has restaurants, souvenir shops and re-creations of 13th-century villages depicting life and traditions during the era of Genghis Khan&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Welcome to Mongolia&#x2019;s capital city, where you see the contrast between ancient traditions and the dawning of a 20th-century democracy.&#xA0; Traditional gers and Buddhist monasteries coexist with modern high-rises.&#xA0; You are met and escorted to your centrally located hotel, which is within walking distance of museums and shops. &#xA0;The city was founded in 1639 as a nomadic Buddhist monastic center. &#xA0;In 1778, it became a permanent settlement at the junction of the Tuul and Selbe rivers.&#xA0; In the evening enjoy a performance featuring traditional Mongolian dancers and hoomi (throat) Singers followed by a welcome dinner.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Blue Sky Tower (D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Ulaanbaatar &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, visit the National History Museum for an excellent overview of Mongolia&#x2019;s history and culture.&#xA0; The newly remodeled museum displays traditional implements of daily nomadic life including Stone and Bronze Age artifacts, historical costumes of Mongolia&#x2019;s minority tribes, sacred religious relics, and agricultural, fishing, and hunting equipment.&#xA0; Next, travel back in time with a visit to the dinosaur halls of the Natural History Museum, showcasing the spectacular fossils found in the Gobi desert. &#xA0;On display are fierce Tarbosaurous fossils (related to Tyrannosaurus Rex), dinosaur eggs, large hadrosaur fossils (duck-billed dinosaurs), and many others, all of which illustrate the richness and importance of the paleontological sites in the Gobi desert. &#xA0;In the afternoon, visit the Zanabazar Fine Arts Museum.&#xA0; Named in honor of Zanabazar, the first Buddhist leader of Mongolia and renowned sculptor, artist, and politician of the 17th century, the museum contains one of the best collections of Buddhist art and artifacts in the world, including many of Zanabazar&#x2019;s original works.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Hotel Blue Sky Tower (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Ulaanbaatar/ Gobi Desert&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, transfer for your private flight to the Gobi Desert, the fifth-largest desert in the world and Asia's largest.&#xA0; Fly via central Mongolia with a stop to refuel and discover Kharakhorum, the site of the 13th century capital of the Mongol Empire.&#xA0; The empire created by Chinggis (Genghis) Khan and his descendants was the largest contiguous land empire in recorded history.&#xA0; The son of Khan, Ogedei, created the legendary city of Kharakhorum to serve as the capital of this monolithic empire.&#xA0; Once a bustling multi-cultural city, Kharakhorum was later abandoned by Khubilai Khan for his new capital in Beijing, and eventually it fell into ruin. &#xA0;Nearby, Mongolia&#x2019;s largest monastery, Erdene Zuu, was reputedly constructed from the ruins of Kharakhorum in the 16th century.&#xA0; Surrounded by over 108 stupas, Erdene Zuu has been a place of Buddhist activity for centuries.&#xA0; Fly on to the vast Gobi Desert.&#xA0; Contrary to the sterile sameness that the word &#x2018;desert&#x2019; suggests, the Gobi is a diverse and fascinating region, and includes sites of some of the most important paleontological discoveries of the 20th century.&#xA0; For the next few days, enjoy the stunning landscapes of the Gobi, habitat for Bactrian camels, Argali mountain sheep, goitered gazelle, golden eagles, Saker falcons, jerboas (similar to kangaroo rats), and many endemic reptiles.&#xA0; Upon arrival at Three Camel Lodge, an award-winning eco-lodge located near the Gurvansaikhan Gobi National Park, settle in into your traditional Mongolian yurt or ger before your afternoon activities that include exploring ancient petroglyphs of Bulagtai Mountain; learning about traditional Mongolian calligraphy; or participating intraditional Mongolian games that reflect aspects of nomadic life.&#xA0; For centuries, games have been used to pass on Mongolian traditions from generation to generation, and to keep nomadic values alive among herder families.&#xA0; After a welcome dinner, enjoy stargazing under the vast Gobi sky with an astronomy lecturer.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Three Camel Lodge (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Gobi Desert - Hongoryn Els Sand Dunes &amp;amp; Hermen Tsav&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, fly by private plane or helicopter to the western Gobi to the landmark dinosaur site known as the Khermen Tsav.&#xA0; This is one of Gobi&#x2019;s most remote areas and only few paleontologists visit the area because of its remoteness and the harsh terrain.&#xA0; Many important dinosaur fossils have been discovered in the area.&#xA0; One of the leading paleontologists of Mongolia will join you on this trip to interpret Mongolia&#x2019;s prehistoric sites and the importance of the dinosaur fossils.&#xA0; Fly to see the towering sand dunes of Hongoryn Els, which run 60 miles alongside the Gobi Altai Mountains.&#xA0; These "Singing Sands," reaching upwards of 183 meters/600 feet, are the Gobi&#x2019;s most magnificent sand dunes and due to their isolation, the secret of this area&#x2019;s beauty has been kept safe for thousands of years.&#xA0; Explore the dunes on foot or from the back of a Bactrian camel.&#xA0;&#xA0;You will also visit a nomadic family to experience their renowned hospitality firsthand, and learn about the basics of a nomadic lifestyle that dates back thousands of years.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Three Camel Lodge (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Gobi Desert - Moltsog Els / Flaming Cliffs&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After a leisurely breakfast, drive to Moltsog Els, one of the few regions of the Gobi covered by sand dunes.&#xA0; Explore the area on foot or, take the opportunity to further explore by camel.&#xA0; Next, drive to the legendary Flaming Cliffs, named for the red-orange sandstone that glows brilliantly at sunrise and sunset. &#xA0;It was here in 1923 that Dr. Roy Chapman Andrews and his exploration team from the American Museum of Natural History found the first nest of dinosaur eggs the world had ever seen.&#xA0; To the trained eye, the ancient formations of the Flaming Cliffs are rich with fossils, and paleontological expeditions continue to make significant discoveries at this site.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Three Camel Lodge (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Gobi Desert / Gorkhi Terelj National Park&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Fly to Gorkhi Terelj National Park, almost entirely uninhabited region. &#xA0;There is, however, a small southern portion of the park that is developed with restaurants, souvenir shops, ger camps, and a park with re-creations of small villages depicting the life and traditions of Khan&#x2019;s era, including Shaman&#x2019;s Village, Great Khan&#x2019;s Village, Herder&#x2019;s Village, Educational Village and Craftsmen&#x2019;s Village.&#xA0; The area offers hiking, horseback riding and rafting.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Terelj Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; The Galapagos Islands &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you will spend the day visiting North Seymour Island aboard the yacht Narel on a shared basis.&#xA0; The boat has capacity for 16 passengers.&#xA0;&#xA0;The island was lifted from the ocean floor by a seismic event, and its origins as a seabed give the island its low, flat profile.&#xA0; Cliffs only a few meters high form the shoreline, where swallow-tailed gulls perch on ledges.&#xA0; A tiny forest of silver-grey palo santo trees stand just above the landing, usually without leaves, waiting for the rain to bring them into bloom.&#xA0; You might have to give way to a passing sea lion or marine iguana.&#xA0; Blue-footed booby nests sit beside the trail, where mating pairs perform their courtship dance.&#xA0; Further along, the rocky shore mixes with white sand, and large flocks of pelicans mass to begin a dive-bombing feeding frenzy in the waters nearby.&#xA0; The trail turns inland to reveal the largest nesting site in the Galapagos of the magnificent frigate bird.&#xA0;&#xA0;These huge, dark acrobats have two-meter wingspans, and males, with puffed up scarlet throat sacks, sit precariously perched in low bushes to watch over their equally large chicks.&#xA0;&#xA0;In the afternoon, you may visit Las Bachas (depending&#xA0;on conditions), a sandy white-coral beach that is a major egg-laying site for sea turtles.&#xA0; On the shore, there are many marine iguanas and in the lagoon, flamingos are commonly seen.&#xA0; This beach is also a good place for swimming and snorkeling.&#xA0; Galapagos has been a place where people from the highlands, the coast and even the jungle immigrated to, and they have influenced the food as well.&#xA0; Tonight, the owner of Safari Camp will open her kitchen and teach you some of the traditional dishes of the region.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Galapagos Safari Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10: &#xA0;The Galapagos Islands &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today aboard the yacht Narel, you set out for Bartolome Island, about a two-and-a-half hour trip each way.&#xA0; The beach landing is wet.&#xA0; Take some insect repellent.&#xA0;&#xA0;A short ten-minute walk across a sand dune takes you to the southern beach, where harmless black-tipped reef sharks and rays are often seen in the warm, shallow water.&#xA0; Snorkeling is banned here to protect the marine life.&#xA0; Ghost crabs creep over the sand and disappear as you approach.&#xA0; Look up at the sky and often you may see a juvenile Galapagos hawk hovering overhead.&#xA0; The summit trail begins with a dry landing, though sea lions make the purpose-built dock more exciting.&#xA0; The trail is a dusty walk through volcanic ash.&#xA0; The only vegetation are pioneer plants, grey tiquilia and greenish chamaesyce.&#xA0; These are vital in binding the ash that fans down from the hill.&#xA0; The park wardens have built wooden steps up the hill to prevent further erosion by humans.&#xA0; The reddish spatter cones were minor eruptions of highly viscous material that cooled rapidly.&#xA0; The summit is such a cone; it seems higher than 114m as you climb the steps.&#xA0; The eastern side has many small lava tubes.&#xA0; The hike is better before 10:00 am or after 16:00 pm, when the light is softer.&#xA0; If you look carefully you can make out sunken craters in the sea below.&#xA0; In the distance you can see most of the central islands, the peaks of Isabela to the west, and on a clear day Marchena and Pinta to the north.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Galapagos Safari Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11:&#xA0; The Galapagos Islands &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you will be driven to the Eastern part of the island to enjoy the morning in the beautiful and pristine Garrapatero Beach.&#xA0; The contrast of mangroves, black lava, white sand, pioneer cacti and turquoise water are a spectacle, particularly with the buzzing coastal bird life and the small lagoon near the beach where you often spot pink flamingos and bahama ducks.&#xA0; Kayaking is possible.&#xA0; You have lunch at a local restaurant in Bellavista or a picnic, if you prefer, before doing&#xA0; touring the area by foot or mountain bike.&#xA0; You stop at a coffee farm to savour and learn about islands grown coffee.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Galapagos Safari Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 12:&#xA0; Galapagos&#xA0;/ Quito&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you will be transferred back to Baltra airport to take the flight back to the mainland, where upon arrival you will be met and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Gangotena &#x2013; Plaza View Room&#xA0;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>India:  A Touch of Adventure</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;&#x201C;Since my first trip to India, I have been amazed by its outstanding culture and enigmatic lifestyle.&#xA0; I also love outdoor and adventure activities.&#xA0; As I was touring all these wonderful places, I started to wonder how I could add more adventurous activities.&#xA0; How could I do that when visiting these places?&#xA0;&#xA0;I imagined touring the crowded streets of Delhi early in the morning on Segway!&#xA0; Then I discovered that we could do a zip-line ride in Jodhpur from one of the biggest forts in India, Mehrangarh Fort, which sits 400 feet above the city.&#xA0; From an old outpost, we travel by camelback into the desert, visiting traditional villages along the way. And at Kabini, we go to a completely different habitat, an uncrowded area of Nagarhole National Park, where we set out on a wildlife safari by boat or vehicle.&#xA0; For me, this trip offers a perfect blend of activity with cultural and historic sites and authentic encounters.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;Gisela Polo, Destination Specialist&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Following breakfast, set out for Agra, en route stopping at 16th-century Fatehpur Sikri.&#xA0; The richest period of history can be attributed to the Mughal period.&#xA0; This is officially a city and a district but in reality, this historical fa&#xE7;ade is a mere ghost town of the past.&#xA0; Well preserved, Fatehpur Sikri was built to support a sprawling ancient city.&#xA0; Some 15 years after the town was built, water resources began to run out and there were disturbances from the Northwest frontier so the city was abandoned.&#xA0; This phantom city is immaculately preserved within wherein one can witness various monuments which are architectural wonders from the Mughal times.&#xA0; From the Buland Darwaza, the main entrance to this ancient city, to the Tomb of Shaikh Salim Chisti, there are numerous noteworthy monuments.&#xA0; Continue your drive to Agra.&#xA0; In the afternoon, investigate Agra Fort and the fabled Taj Mahal.&#xA0; Agra Fort features its imposing turrets, gateways and a moat.&#xA0; The beauty of its inner quadrangle is seen in its fine proportions and rich ornamentation, as well as the position of the doors, windows and colonnades.&#xA0; Taj Mahal is regarded by many as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a style that combines elements from Persian, Ottoman Turkish and Indian architectural styles.&#xA0; It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&#xA0; While the white-domed marble mausoleum is the most familiar component of the Taj Mahal, it is actually an integrated complex of structures.&#xA0; The construction began around 1632 and was completed around 1653, employing thousands of artisans and craftsmen.&#xA0; The result is s stunning complex with the mausoleum as the main attraction.&#xA0; Millions come to watch its many colors evolve with the day - pink in the morning, milky white in the evening and golden when the moon shines.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Oberoi Amarvilas - Premier room with Balcony (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 15:&#xA0; Agra / Delhi&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Following breakfast, you will be driven to Delhi.&#xA0; Upon arrival, check in to your hotel.&#xA0; The rest of the day is yours to use as you wish.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Oberoi Gurgaon - Luxury Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

The wadi forms a huge winding canyon, with dramatic cliffs of white limestone.&#xA0; Porous travertine form stalactites along overhanging cliff edges.&#xA0; The canyon forms a natural refuge for wildlife such as hyenas, camels, ibex and gazelles and other mammals.&#xA0; Five islands just off the coast of Shuwaymiyah are a haven for migratory birds and marine life and breeding marine turtles.&#xA0; Pods of dolphin are just off shore.&#xA0; This is a good spot for sport fishermen and the rocky coast of the islands offer underwater sites for snorkeling.&#xA0; Offshore waters provide rich feeding grounds for nesting seabirds and non-breeding visitors, including petrels from the Southern Hemisphere.&#xA0; You continue to Shuwaymiyah beach where you will set up camp for the evening.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Luxury Mobile Beach Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

En route, the stark shape of leafless frankincense trees dot the landscape.&#xA0; Once traded as a commodity more precious than gold, frankincense harvested in Dhofar is rated the best in the world.&#xA0; Return to your hotel where you will enjoy your last night in the Sultanate.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Hilton Salalah Resort &#x2013; Hilton Guest Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>Peru:  The Flavors of Peru</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;&#x201C;As a Peruvian, one of the many things I am proud of is our food.&#xA0; The flavors and textures always remind me of my childhood, and the family parties organized by my grandmother, my mother, and later myself and other family members.&#xA0; I have traveled a lot to all the corners of my country, and I discovered that each region has its special flavor.&#xA0; And, it is not just the taste, but also the whole process and the environment.&#xA0; For me, it is a reason for a reunion.&#xA0; I want to convey to my clients the pleasure of going to a market to buy fresh fish to make ceviche!&#xA0; Or have them watch the process of cooking a &#x201C;Pachamanca&#x201D; in a hole in the earth; or enjoy a variety of dishes while they&#xA0;watch a Peruvian Paso horse perform.&#xA0; We also want them to visit the best Peruvian restaurants, where today&#x2019;s chefs are rescuing the flavors of yesteryear.&#x201D;&#xA0; Gisela Polo, Destination Specialist&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Lima / Cuzco / Urubamba Valley&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Transfer to the airport to board your flight to Cuzco.&#xA0; You are met on arrival and transferred to Pisaq in the fertile Sacred Valley of the Incas (Urubamba Valley) for a half day tour, first visiting the village of Pisaq, with its Indian Market, Peru&#x2019;s most famous, colorful market.&#xA0; Enjoy a typical &#x201C;pachamanca&#x201D;, while the technique of cooking in the earth is found around the globe, the specifics of how it is done are infinitely variable.&#xA0; One of the most unique approaches is found here in Peru where hot rocks are used in lieu of smoldering coals.&#xA0; And, like in other cultures, cooking in this manner is a communal affair.&#xA0; The repast becomes a celebration in and of itself.&#xA0; Even though the hostess is cooking for all comers, you find yourself getting caught up in the spectacle. &#xA0;After lunch, enjoy a tour to Ollantaytambo - a beautiful and tranquil village. &#xA0;Here, you find some spectacular and extensive Inca ruins, most of them enclosed with a Temple Fortress.&#xA0; The unfinished temple, begun by the Pachacuti, contains some of the largest stones ever used by the Inca builders. &#xA0;The village itself is constructed on top of Inca foundations - so you can see typical Inca stonework down almost any street.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Rio Sagrado Hotel (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&#xA0; Urubamba Valley&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Depart by vehicle this morning to the ruins of Moray.&#xA0; Your guide will take you down into these ruins and explain their function.&#xA0; It is said that the ancient agricultural terraces of circular and concentric shape, which were built by the Incas, were used as a seed-producing area for the principal crops of the empire: &#xA0;maize and potato.&#xA0; Start walking towards the town of Maras through the countryside, surrounded now by farmlands and the occasional local habitat. &#xA0;The view of the mountain ranges never fades away.&#xA0; (The path you&#x2019;ll take is mostly flat.)&#xA0; Once you get to Maras there are several things to see and visit. &#xA0;Influenced by the Spanish conquerors, some of the doorposts are in colonial style and beautifully worked.&#xA0; On your way&#xA0;to the salt Pans, you will have a deluxe picnic in the middle of awesome scenery.&#xA0; You will continue to the salt pans, you&#x2019;ll spend some time so the guide can explain how the salt-draining process works.&#xA0; You might even have the chance to try making salt yourself.&#xA0; Your descent into the Sacred Valley starts off on a narrow path, and you will need to walk cautiously. You may spot the Cara Cara, a typical Andean mountain-bird and a member of the falcon family. &#xA0;The path, which runs alongside a gorge, takes you down to the Urubamba River.&#xA0; On one side is the brook which also runs through the saltpans. &#xA0;Because of its high salt content, it turns the earth on its banks white.&#xA0; Other birds you might spot while you approach the river are the Andean gull and the hummingbird.&#xA0; After you cross the hanging bridge, the van will pick you up to take you back to the hotel.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Rio Sagrado Hotel (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Important&#xA0;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0; This evening you will need to pack a small bag for your rail journey tomorrow.&#xA0; For all Perurail journeys, each passenger is allowed 1 bag or backpack which must not exceed 05kg/11pounds and/or 62 inches/157cm (length + height + width).&#xA0; Please pack light.&#xA0; Baggage that exceeds these measurements will not be allowed.&#xA0; Your additional luggage will be stored by your Big Five representative.&lt;/em&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

This morning you are transferred to the Poroy rail station to board the Hiram Bingham train to Machu Picchu. &#xA0;The train journey from Cusco to Machu Picchu is a highlight of any trip to the Andes.&#xA0;&#xA0;The Hiram Bingham will depart Cusco's Poroy Station at about 9:00 a.m.&#xA0; Brunch will be served on board while travelers enjoy spectacular scenery as it unfolds through the large windows.&#xA0; The 3 &#xBD; hour journey takes you through the Sacred Valley, passing by lush, green fields and colorful villages in the foothills of the Andes.&#xA0; From here on, there are wonderful vistas of the mountains and, deep in its dramatic canyon, the beautiful Urubamba River running through the Sacred Valley. &#xA0;You will arrive at the train station of Aguas Calientes around 12:30 PM.&#xA0; You shall meet your private guide here and transfer by small bus to the entrance of the ruins to commence your touring.&#xA0;&#xA0;Machu Picchu rises to an altitude of 7,900 ft. above sea level. &#xA0;The fortress sits&#xA0;between the Huayna Picchu (young peak) and Machu Picchu (old peak).&#xA0; It lies within the spectacular framework provided by the exuberant vegetation of nearby jungle and the rugged landscape.&#xA0; The ruins are situated on the eastern slope of Machu Picchu in two different areas: &#xA0;the agricultural and the urban.&#xA0; The latter includes the civil sector (dwellings, canalizations), and the sacred sector (temples, mausoleums, squares, royal houses). &#xA0;Although constructions show different levels of architecture, religious buildings exhibit a high degree of perfection.&#xA0; The construction was with general use of stone, and the roofs were built of tree trunks and thatched with ichu straw. &#xA0;The walls were made with an inward inclination for protection against earthquakes.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge &#x2013; Mountain room (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Machu Picchu / Cusco&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; Cusco&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
High in the Andes, about 11,400 feet above sea level is Cusco, considered the oldest continuously inhabited city in the Western Hemisphere and of major historical importance.&#xA0; Founded in the 15th century by the Incas, it was later conquered by Spain and much of its architecture reflects the dramatic Spanish style of what is known as Cusco Baroque.&#xA0; The Incas conceived their capital in the shape of a Puma with the river serving as the spine, Sacsayhuaman the head and the main city center the body.&#xA0; Almost every central street has remains of Inca walls, arches and doorways.&#xA0; Before lunch a walk is planned through the San Pedro market to familiarize you with the local ingredients.&#xA0; It is an open-air, local market with many venders and full of color and a great variety of foods.&#xA0; For lunch we go to Tupananchis restaurant for a cooking demonstration and preparation of your own meal.&#xA0; Enjoy a half day visit of this magical city as you drive through the main streets with their Inca walls. &#xA0;Visit the Qorikancha (Sun Temple) now referred to as Santo Domingo Church.&#xA0; The curved stonework of the temple is probably unequalled in the world. &#xA0;During the Inca period, the stones were covered with gold.&#xA0; Then, visit the archaeological sites that surround Cusco:&#xA0; The Saqsayhuaman Fortress, an amazing site with huge stone constructions. &#xA0;The site has a great cosmic energy - that is why people think it was an astronomic observatory and an Inca oracle. &#xA0;Also visit Q&#x2019;enqo, a place that was used for worship and ceremonial center. &#xA0;Back to the city, visit the San Pedro Local Market where you will see the real life of Cusco and then proceed to &#x201C;San Blas&#x201D;, the Artisans&#x2019; Neighborhood of narrow and high streets, beautiful little plaza, where the fibers of wool, the pieces of clay and the wood pieces turned into real art pieces.&#xA0; Continue to see the famous Twelve Angles stone, part of the largest Inca wall of Cusco, which used to be the Hatunrumiyoc (Big Stone) palace, built by Inca Sinchi Roca.&#xA0; This is an example of Inca skill with polygonal masonry.&#xA0; At night you will visit La Divina Comedia Restaurant and will enjoy a delicious dinner.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Monasterio &#x2013; Deluxe oxygenated Room (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>Tibet:  Legends of Shiva  </tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;&#x201C;Most people who travel to Tibet do so in conjunction with mainland China or Nepal, and spend most of their time in Lhasa with possibly short excursions out of the city, unless they are climbing Mt. Everest.&#xA0; This extensive 21-day tour takes on new dimensions.&#xA0; It removes any political aspects and introduces Tibet as a stand-alone destination.&#xA0; Here, you travel to places where the residents are, for the most part, are not even aware of the outside world.&#xA0; They simply live their lives keeping to their own traditions and a way of life not seen elsewhere.&#xA0; This is the original Tibet.&#xA0; Also, Tibet is generally seen through the vantage point of landscapes or Buddhism, however, this journey brings Tibet and her religious attributes full circle back to India.&#xA0; The best examples of this lie in ancient mythology.&#xA0; Buddhism has its origins in India while breathtaking sights such as Mt. Kailash have strong links to Hindu Gods such as Shiva.&#xA0; It is said that Mt. Kailash was the abode of Lord Shiva, and the birthplace of Jainism.&#xA0; That is what makes this mountain so unusual &#x2013;&#xA0;it is regarded as one of the most sacred to Hindu, Jain and Buddhist religions and serves as a pilgrimage site for all.&#xA0; This mountain holds sacred value to me personally as my son was named after Lord Shiva.&#xA0; This journey explores Tibet off the beaten track, traveling into Western Tibet stopping in Sangsang, Saga, Payang and Baga en route.&#xA0; The accommodations are sometimes very basic guesthouses, but travelers will be completely enchanted as it is quite likely they will quite literally the only &#x2018;tourists&#x2019; in sight.&#xA0; The surrounding natural Himalayan scenery is exquisite throughout the long drives.&#xA0; This is not a program for everyone.&#xA0; This once-in-a-lifetime adventure, however, will be utterly captivating to those who take on this remarkable country.&#x201D;&#xA0; Ashish Sanghrajka, President&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/ul&gt;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Lhasa, Tibet&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Welcome to Tibet!&#xA0; Upon arrival you will be met by your Tibetan guide and driver and privately transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; En route to town you drive along the Yarlung Tsangpo River and Lhasa River, past Tibetan villages and the Nyetang Buddha.&#xA0; The remainder of the day is at leisure to help you to acclimatize to the altitude.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Jardin Secret Hotel &#x2013; Superior Room (D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Lhasa&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you begin with an unforgettable visit to the stunning Potala Palace, which was once home to the local Tibet government.&#xA0; It was divided into two sections: the white palace, which were the living quarters and the red palace solely reserved for religious study and prayer.&#xA0; The palace is comprised of over 1,000 rooms, 10,000 shrines and about 200,000 statues.&#xA0; It is also the highest castle-style palace in the world.&#xA0; You will also visit the seventh-century Jokhang Temple, which is located at the heart of Lhasa&#x2019;s old town. &#xA0;Here you will enjoy a fascinating combination of deep religious faith and push-and-shove market economics.&#xA0; In Tibetan Buddhism, Jokhang is also regarded as the &#x201C;Center of the Universe,&#x201D; and is the must-see place in Tibet.&#xA0; The temple is home to the holiest golden Buddha in all of Tibetan Buddhism, and Tibetans walk for months from the countryside to Lhasa to make a pilgrimage to Jokhang Temple.&#xA0; After your visit you will stroll throughout the markets and alleyways of Old Lhasa before visiting a small nunnery only for women known as Ani Tsang Kuang.&#xA0; Here you will witness firsthand inside the nunnery how the women practice their religion in Tibetan Buddhism.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Jardin Secret Hotel &#x2013; Superior Room (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&#xA0; Lhasa&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, visit the biggest monastery in Tibet, Drepung Monastery, founded in 1416.&#xA0; The Ganden-Phodrang-Palace at Drepung Monastery was constructed by the 2nd Dalai Lama in 1518 and declared his chief residence/governmental palace until the inauguration of Potala Palace by the 5th Dalai Lama.&#xA0; One report from the 1930s noted that the monastery was home to 7,700 monks.&#xA0; Afterwards you will tour the Norbulingka, which was the former summer palace for Dalai Lama in Lhasa.&#xA0; It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is a unique representation of Tibetan palace architecture.&#xA0; At the end of the day, you will be invited to visit a traditional family to learn more about everyday life in Tibet.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Jardin Secret Hotel &#x2013; Superior Room (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&#xA0; Lhasa / Gyantse&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Set out for Gyantse. &#xA0;En route, you stop at Yamdrok Lake, regarded as the turquoise of Tibet.&#xA0; You encounter Karola Pass, which is about 5,029 meters/16,500 feet above sea level.&#xA0; You pass by a glacier runs along the side of the road here.&#xA0; Upon arrival in Gyantse, explore the Kumbum, which was constructed between 1418 and 1427.&#xA0; It is designed in classic stupa, or pagoda, style, octagonal in shape, and is 35 meters/115 feet high.&#xA0; It has a nine-story terraced exterior with 108 chapels and superb murals and is capped with a gold dome.&#xA0; Discover the old town and its market.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Gyantse Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: &#xA0;Gyantse / Shigatse&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
You spot the gold roof shinning in the sunlight long before you arrive at Tashilhunpo Monastery.&#xA0; Thousands of Buddhists and visitors from home and abroad drawn here.&#xA0; Founded in 1447, the monastery has stood witness for five centuries, and still maintains glimpses of its original magnificent vigor.&#xA0; It is one of the six monasteries of Gelugpa (or Yellow Hat Sect) in China.&#xA0; It has been the traditional seat of successive Panchen Lamas, who are the second highest ranking Tulku lineage in the Gelugpa tradition.&#xA0; All the Panchen lamas have managed to expand the monastery gradually over the centuries.&#xA0; Tashilhunpo at its height had more than 4,000 monks and supported four Tantric colleges.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Shigatse Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6:&#xA0; Shigatse / Latze&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today set out for Latze with a stop at the Sakya Monastery en route.&#xA0; Sitting on a hillside in Sakya County, its Mongolian architecture is unlike the temples in Lhasa.&#xA0; The only surviving ancient building is the Lhakang Chempo or Sibgon Trulpa.&#xA0; This ancient monastery was started in 1073.&#xA0; This is the first monastery of Sakya Sect, and it houses the largest collation of manuscripts of any temple in the country, with more than 28,000 volumes of sermons.&#xA0; In Latze, you check into the first in a series of guesthouses for the evening.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Guesthouse (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 7-9: &#xA0;Latze / Sangsang / Saga / Paryang / Baga&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Relatively few people ever visit Tibet, and fewer still travel into Western Tibet.&#xA0; For the next couple of days, drive deeper into Tibet, past small villages such as Sangsang, with just over 200 residents. Saga is an army town with a Chinese garrison that patrols the Tibetan-Nepalese border.&#xA0; It is also an important stop for pilgrims on the way to visit the sacred Mt. Kailash.&#xA0; Paryang is another small traditional village.&#xA0; Baga is known for producing cheese.&#xA0; Accommodations in this part of the world are very basic guesthouses.&#xA0; But that allows you to have the most authentic experience possible as you encounter everyday people and see how they live and work.&#xA0; You will likely be the only &#x201C;tourists&#x201D; in site. &#xA0;The surrounding Himalayan scenery is magnificent throughout the long drives.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Guesthouses (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10: &#xA0;Baga / Darchen / Mt. Kailash Trek&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Once you reach the mythic Mt. Kailash you join others &#x2013; pilgrims who are on their kora, holy pilgrimage circumambulation around the mountain. &#xA0;You are in for an amazing and unique cultural experience.&#xA0; This is one of, if not the, holiest sites in three major world religions &#x2013; Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism as well as B&#xF6;npo (the religion in Tibet prior to the arrival of Buddhism).&#xA0; Hindus consider Mt. Kailash to be the center of the universe as it is the home of the god Shiva.&#xA0; Buddhists revere the holy mountain as the home of the Buddha Demchock.&#xA0; Jains believe that Kailash is known as Ashtapada &#x2013; the location where one of the original 24 teachers, or Tirthankaras, gained enlightenment.&#xA0; For adherents of the B&#xF6;n religion, Mt. Kailash is the home of their founder.&#xA0; Over the next few days, you will walk an ancient and sacred clockwise path around the mountain that countless pilgrims &#x2013; and very few tourists &#x2013; have done for centuries.&#xA0; You will hike some 23 kilometers/14 miles to Dri-ra-puk and your camp.&#xA0; Vehicles are not permitted to drive around, so it is necessary to hire yaks and their owners to transport you to your comfortable tents at the end of the day.&#xA0; The scenery is incredible, and the spiritual atmosphere is innocent, authentic and inescapable.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Tents (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 11:&#xA0; Mt. Kailash Trek - Dri-ra-puk / Zutrul Puk&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Trek another 23 kilometers/14 miles from Dri-ra-puk to Zutrul Puk. &#xA0;This is the most difficult part of the hike leading up to the high pass of Dromala that sits at 5,630 meters/18,471 feet.&#xA0; Then travel on to Zutrul Puk, the renowned meditating cave for Milarepa.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Tents (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 12: &#xA0;Mt. Kailash Trek - Zutrul Puk / Lake Manasarovar &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Hike from Zutrul Puk to Lake Manasarovar, about 11 kilometers/6.8 miles, completing the circumambulation of Mt. Kailash. &#xA0;Lake Manasarovar is one three holy lakes in Tibet, and is at the highest altitude of all fresh water lakes in Tibet.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Tents (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 13: &#xA0;Mt. Kailash / Darchen / Drada &#x2013; Guge Kingdom Ruins&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Descend the mountain and drive to Drada via Darchen.&#xA0; Outside Drada, you explore the ruins of the lost Kingdom of Guge, founded in 10th century.&#xA0; These ruins were once an imperial estate that fell into disrepair after civil revolt and the invasion of the allied armies of eight foreign countries.&#xA0; The Guge Kingdom also encountered these problems, which fragmented the once prosperous state.&#xA0; However, the legendary kingdom hasn't been totally lost and much can be learned about it from its remains.&#xA0; The ruins now extend around the sides of a mountain more than 300 meters/984 feet high.&#xA0; Explorers have found more than 400 rooms and 800 caves, as well as fortresses, secret pathways, pagodas, arms storerooms, granaries and many burial sites.&#xA0; Except for a few temples, all the roofs of the rooms have collapsed, leaving only the walls.&#xA0; They are surrounded by a city wall and a fortress marks each of the corners.&#xA0; Palaces, temples and local residences are distributed from the top to the bottom and only once-secret roads lead to the top.&#xA0; This layout was designed to indicate the supremacy of the king and to ensure the safety of the palaces.&#xA0; Due to its great research value, these ruins have been listed under the first group of Cultural Relics of National Importance under the Protection of the State.&#xA0; Continue to Drada where you will overnight.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Guesthouse (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 14-16:&#xA0; Drada / Baga / Payang / Saga&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
You return via the same route back through Western Tibet staying in guesthouses along the way.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Guesthouse (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 17:&#xA0; Saga / Baicutso Lake / Tingri&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Drive to Tingri via Baicutso Lake.&#xA0; It is often used as a base by mountain climbers preparing to ascend Mt. Everest or Mt. Cho Oyu.&#xA0; At an altitude of about 4,300 meters/14,107 feet, it is known for its spectacular views of Mt. Everest, Mt. Lhotse, Mt. Makalu and Mt. Cho Oyu, which are four of the six highest mountains in the world.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Everest Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 18:&#xA0; Tingri &#x2013; Everest Basecamp&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Early this morning, you proceed to Everest Basecamp, stopping to visit Rongbuk Monastery at the foot of Mt. Everest.&#xA0; At an altitude of about 5,000 meters/16,404 feet, it is the highest temple in the world, and a spectacular place to take in the scenery of Mt. Everest.&#xA0; After exploring the monastery, hike up to Everest Basecamp for amazing views of Mt. Everest (subject to weather conditions).&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Everest Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 19:&#xA0; Tingri / Shigatse&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Drive back to Shigatse, and check into your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Shigatse Hotel (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7: &#xA0;Bwindi Impenetrable Forest&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This day will likely be the highlight of your Uganda adventure, for today you set out in search of the critically endangered mountain gorillas.&#xA0; After breakfast, take a short drive to park headquarters to meet with excellent local guides and trackers who present a talk on the etiquette of gorilla trekking.&#xA0; You then hike into the forest, where the gorillas were seen the night before.&#xA0; You must be in good physical shape because the trekking can take from one to six hours, and climb to altitudes in excess of 7,500 feet.&#xA0; The terrain is rough and, at times, muddy.&#xA0; Although the hike is physically demanding, the beauty of the forest and surrounding scenery make it worthwhile.&#xA0; Once you have found the gorillas, all thoughts of fatigue vanish.&#xA0; Those who have spent time in their company describe the encounter as the most profound natural history experience in the world.&#xA0; Others speak in terms of a spiritual experience.&#xA0; Whatever your reaction, you will be profoundly moved by these gentle animals. &#xA0;Picnic lunches are provided.&#xA0; Rain can come anytime in the forest so waterproof clothing is essential, including zip lock bags for cameras, video equipment, etc.&#xA0; Please be aware that you will be trekking wild animals and although the chances of seeing them are high, no one can guarantee a sighting as they move through their home range.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Gorilla Forest Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; Bwindi Impenetrable Forest&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Bwindi Forest is home to a fantastic diversity of flora and fauna, including some exotic plants and rare and endangered animals.&#xA0; The forest is thought to have one of the richest fauna communities in East Africa.&#xA0; The forest is also home to the Batwa pygmies, the original dwellers of the ancient forest.&#xA0; They were known as the &#x2018;keepers of the forest.&#x2019;&#xA0; The Batwa lived in harmony with the forest and survived by hunting small game using bows and arrows, and by gathering plants for both food and medicinal purposes.&#xA0; But, in 1992 the lives of the Batwa changed forever, when the forest became a national park for the protection of the gorillas.&#xA0; The Batwa were evicted from the park and became conservation refugees in a world that was very unfamiliar to them.&#xA0; Their skills and means of subsistence were not useful in this modern environment and they began to suffer.&#xA0;&#xA0;In 2001, when the Batwa tribe was on the edge of extinction, two American medical missionaries came to their rescue, purchasing land for the tribe and establishing programs to improve the conditions and lives of the Batwa.&#xA0; This included the building of a school, hospital and housing.&#xA0; They also developed water and sanitation projects, and found ways that the Batwa could generate income and to sustain their community.&#xA0; These projects are now managed and operated by the Batwa Development Program (BDP).&#xA0; BDP works closely with the Batwa community to try to ensure that their indigenous rights are respected and they also benefit from the forest being a national park and a tourism site.&#xA0; The Batwa cultural experience was created to educate their children and to share their amazing heritage and traditions with the world.&#xA0; Here, you have the opportunity to hike through the forest with a Batwa guide, who shares his knowledge of the forest and see it through his eyes; or, visit a traditional Batwa homestead and learn from the women how to prepare, cook and serve a meal; or, talk to a medicine man about the medicinal properties of the forest flora; and hear ancient legends and traditional songs.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Gorilla Forest Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0; Bwindi Impenetrable Forest&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today, you have a second day to track gorillas, and see them in their natural habitat.&#xA0; There are only about 340 individuals in the park.&#xA0; They are known as the Bwindi population and make up almost half of the population of mountain gorillas in the world.&#xA0; It takes just a few minutes in the presence of these magnificent creatures to understand how imperative it is that we save them from extinction.&#xA0; This is an encounter you will never forget.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Gorilla Forest Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10: &#xA0;Bwindi Impenetrable Forest / Lake Mburo National Park &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Leave the forest and drive to Mbarara, and eventually into Ankole Cattle country around Mbarara.&#xA0; Continue to Lake Mburo National Park, a small park that is excellent for bird watchers, and home to antelope and other grazers, including impala and Burchell's zebra, which are found nowhere else in Uganda.&#xA0; Game drives offer particularly picturesque game viewing with a mix of savannah, acacia woodlands, grassy valleys, rocky outcrops, swamps, lakes and rolling hills. &#xA0;Herds of impala, buffalo, zebra, waterbuck and eland are among the variety of wildlife found here.&#xA0; Birders will enjoy spotting some of the park's 310 recorded species.&#xA0; In this valley, you can also enjoy a night drive and even a safari on foot.&#xA0; This is the only park where you will also glimpse Burchell's Zebra.&#xA0; You enjoy a game drive en route to the lodge, a peaceful and exclusive retreat adjacent to the park.&#xA0; There are 10 private, comfortable tents on wooden platforms under thatch roofs, all with en suite bathrooms with hot and cold running water, showers and flushing toilets. &#xA0;The main dining area is a large thatched structure built of rocks, the wood of dead weathered olive trees found on the land and native grasses.&#xA0; Below the dining area, an infinity swimming pool stretches out from the rocks and seems to disappear into the vast landscape beyond.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Mihingo Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11:&#xA0; Lake Mburo National Park / Entebbe /&#xA0;Depart&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, you relish a last early morning bush walk in the park.&#xA0; After breakfast, you leave for&#xA0;Entebbe, where a dayroom at Lake Victoria Hotel has been reserved for your convenience.&#xA0; You relax and freshen up before being transferred to the airport for your international departure flight.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt; Lake Victoria Hotel &#x2013; Dayroom (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

&lt;/ul&gt;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Welcome to Mongolia&#x2019;s capital city!&#xA0; You are met and escorted to your centrally located hotel, which is within walking distance of museums and shops.&#xA0; The city was founded in 1639 as a nomadic Buddhist monastic center.&#xA0; In 1778, it became a permanent settlement at the junction of the Tuul and Selbe rivers.&#xA0; In the evening, enjoy a private reception at the hotel with traditional Mongolian music featuring hoomi (throat) singing.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt; Hotel Blue Sky Tower (D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: &#xA0;Ulaanbaatar&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Begin the day in Sukhbaatar Square in the heart of the city.&#xA0; Visit the government house and the Chinggis (Genghis Khan) Statue.&#xA0; The City Administration building was formerly a hotel built in 1936.&#xA0; Other buildings surrounding the square include the Lenin Club building (1929), Printing Press (1929), State Ballet and Opera House (1946&#x2013;1949) and the Stock Exchange building, formerly the Eldev-Ochir Cinema (1946&#x2013;1948).&#xA0; Constructed in 1712, Gandan Monastery was the seat of Buddhism in Mongolia.&#xA0; Woven through Mongolia&#x2019;s nomadic culture is a rich Tibetan Buddhist tradition in which ancient shamanistic practices are still evident.&#xA0; Although Buddhist monasteries were either destroyed or converted into museums during the Stalinist purges of the 1930s, Gandan Monastery continued to operate as a showpiece for government officials.&#xA0; It was closed in 1938 at the height of the purges but escaped destruction and reopened in 1944.&#xA0; It was the only monastery in the country to remain functioning during the Communist era, and one of the very few that escaped destruction.&#xA0; A significant resurgence of Buddhism began in 1990 when Mongolia became a democracy.&#xA0; Monasteries across the country are again opening their doors to worshippers, and the few lamas who survived the purges began training a new generation.&#xA0; At Gandan Monastery, you have a private audience with one of the high-ranking lamas and receive a Buddhist blessing.&#xA0; After lunch at a fine local restaurant, visit the Natural History Museum for an overview of Mongolian geography and natural history and to see some of the spectacular fossils unearthed in the Gobi.&#xA0; On display are a towering Tarbosaurous skeleton (closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex), dinosaur eggs, and the famous &#x201C;fighting dinosaurs.&#x201D;&#xA0; The newly remodeled museum also displays traditional implements of daily nomadic life.&#xA0; It features Stone and Bronze Age artifacts, historical costumes of Mongolia&#x2019;s minority tribes and sacred religious relics as well as agricultural, fishing, and hunting equipment.&#xA0; Savor a private visit to the Paleontological Laboratory to see the work of Mongolian scientists.&#xA0; Later, take in the Zanabazar Fine Arts Museum, named in honor of the renowned 17th century artist and politician, who was also the first Buddhist leader of Mongolia.&#xA0; The museum contains one of the finest collections of Buddhist art and artifacts in the world.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Blue Sky Tower (B,L,D)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

The three departments have a common coffee culture, with beautiful landscapes and friendly people, but each city also has its own unique characteristics.&#xA0; Armenia is the heart of the region.

Although coffee is the major agricultural product, the municipality's diverse ecosystem makes it perfect for the production of fruits and vegetables.

Welcome to Ecuador!&#xA0; Upon arrival, you will be met by our representative who will assist you through immigration and customs formalities and then you will be transferred to your luxury hotel. &#xA0;Our in-country manager will be your guide.&#xA0; In 1973, he designed the first sustainable eco-lodge in the Ecuadorian Amazon, and in 1996, introduced the concept of &#x201C;eco-fishing&#x201D; in collaboration with World Wide Fund as a means of monitoring river and lake ecosystems through ecotourism.&#xA0; He is an internationally known expert of sustainability in Ecuador.&#xA0;&#xA0;Your hotel is in a newly-restored historic mansion overlooking Plaza San Francisco, the three-story Casa Gangotena features 31 rooms of contemporary design with antiques, fine furnishings and modern technologies.&#xA0; Relax and enjoy the glassed-in patio, the garden redolent with the native flowers, wood-panelled library, and the panoramic third-floor terrace.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Gangotena&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2, Wed:&#xA0; Quito&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Surrounded by the Andes Mountains, Quito lies at an elevation of 9,000 feet/2,743 meters in the province of Pichincha.&#xA0; One of the most beautiful capitals in the world, the city was founded as San Francisco de Quito on December 6th, 1534 by Spanish conquistadors.&#xA0; It has been sanctioned through the auspices of UNESCO in 1978 to be a World Cultural Heritage Site.&#xA0; The historic center of Quito, known as the "Old City" is replete with narrow, winding cobblestone streets, magnificent churches and wide-open squares.&#xA0; The buildings that line the streets reflect Spanish colonial influence with their balconies, tile roofs, thick columns and central patios.&#xA0; Today, explore the colonial city with its historical churches and buildings from the 16th and 17th centuries, like the San Diego Cloister, housing art treasures in its mystical corridors and courtyards.&#xA0; Then, continue to the Museum of Guayasamin.&#xA0; Oswaldo Guayasam&#xED;n was born in Quito at the beginning of the 20th century and is considered the premier painter and sculptor in Ecuador.&#xA0; This splendid house-cum-museum houses excellent exhibitions of pre-Columbian, colonial and contemporary art from the artist&#x2019;s private collection.&#xA0; At the time of his death, Guayasam&#xED;n was working on his boldest piece, "The Chapel of Man.&#x201D;&#xA0; Today, the completed piece can be found next door to the museum.&#xA0; Inside the chapel is a collection of artwork paying tribute to pre-Columbian man.&#xA0; The rectangular chapel is said to be heavily influenced by Incan temples and is covered by a dome of copper plate, the inside of which is covered by the artist&#x2019;s unfinished murals.&#xA0; The altar of the chapel contains an eternal flame in defense of peace and human rights.&#xA0; Guayasamin&#x2019;s work has been showed all over the world from Quito&#x2019;s government and legislative palaces, to Paris&#x2019; UNESCO Headquarters, to Sao Paulo&#x2019;s Latin America Parliament, to Madrid&#x2019;s Barajas Airport.&#xA0; This evening, you are invited to the residence of Pablo Guayasamin, the artist&#x2019;s brother.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Gangotena&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3, Thu:&#xA0; Quito / Otavalo &amp;amp; Northern Ecuador&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Transfer to Hacienda Zuleta.&#xA0; For more than 100 years, it has been a colonial working farm of 4,000 acres/2,000 hectares.&#xA0; It belongs to the family of Galo Plaza Lasso, a former president of Ecuador, and has been chosen as one of the world&#x2019;s &#x201C;Top Ten Finds&#x201D; by Outside magazine and named as one of the best Ecuador hotels by National Geographic Traveler.&#xA0; Upon arrival, you will be greeted by one of the descendants of the Plaza Lasso family who will share with you many of the stories of this place.&#xA0; Here, you will also have the opportunity to do horseback riding, hiking, mountain biking and bird watching.&#xA0; Enjoy a special, private shaman ceremony.&#xA0; You will also have the opportunity to get to know the people that live in this area and learn about their traditions and customs.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Zuleta Hacienda &#x2013; Jr. Suite (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5, Sat:&#xA0; Quito / The Galapagos Islands&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
A special adventure begins as you transfer to the airport for a flight to Galapagos.&#xA0; Your airline tickets between Ecuador mainland and Galapagos are issued locally by the cruise line.&#xA0; At the airport, you will meet the cruise representative at the airline ticket counter who will assist with check in and provide you with your boarding pass.&#xA0; Welcome to the Galapagos Islands. &#xA0;Here you will find flightless birds, sea lions, and a bounty of birds, tortoises and iguanas specially adapted to their particular island habitat.&#xA0; Time will allow for observations of the incredibly unique flora, fauna and volcanic terrain, both on foot and on panga excursions.&#xA0; The reason that you travel to Galapagos is to experience the islands and their unique fauna. &#xA0;Therefore, your program will allow you to perceive Galapagos from different perspectives: &#xA0;guided hikes, relaxing beach walks, snorkeling and swimming!&#xA0; You will access the various islands during your voyage by wet or dry landings.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Wet Landings&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Wet Landings are landings on the beach rather than on the shore.&#xA0; Passengers go ashore by swinging their legs over the side of the panga and then stepping off into approximately a foot of water, and finally wading to shore.&#xA0; The process is relatively easy and is done in reverse to board the panga.&#xA0; Unless wearing Tevas or other aqua shoes, the wet landing is made barefoot. &#xA0;Then once on shore there is a few minutes to dry feet and try to remove as much sand as possible before putting on shoes and socks before the natural history walk.&#xA0; Bringing two towels or wash clothes on a wet landing is highly recommended. &#xA0;One towel is used to put your feet on while the other towel is used to dry the feet and get the sand off.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Dry Landings&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Dry Landings are made in areas where the passenger can exit the panga directly on to a rock or lava surface.&#xA0; Shoes can be worn for the duration of a dry landing.&#xA0; This is actually the more difficult landing since the panga continues to move while passengers attempt to step off the boat on to a slippery surface.&#xA0; Good balance and paying attention to what you are doing are key to a successful dry landing. &#xA0;The guide will go ashore first and offer you a hand. &#xA0;Use the help!&#xA0; The guide will tightly grip your hand so you can balance while trying to find your footing. &#xA0;Boarding the panga is done in the same fashion the guide or a crewmember will offer a hand to everyone as they re-board the panga.&#xD;
&#xD;
Although an itinerary of the daily cruise schedule is provided here, it should be used only as a guideline. Cruise itineraries in the Galapagos are affected regularly by seasonal factors and National Park authorities directions issued daily. Your on-board naturalist-guide will give daily briefings on the daily excursions.&#xA0; Each visitation site is a distinct little world unto itself, where you&#x2019;ll enjoy a unique mix of tropical and polar wildlife.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;AM: &#xA0;Baltra Island&lt;/em&gt;&#xD;
Baltra played an important role in the history of these islands.&#xA0; It was used by the U.S. Air Force during the Second World War; many U.S. Navy and crews of the submarines were stationed here to patrol the Pacific Ocean and protect the Panama Canal. &#xA0;Baltra is a flat and dry island surrounded by reefs and few beaches.&#xA0; It has some vegetation such as cacti Opuntia (prickly pear cactus) and other small trees. &#xA0;You will have the opportunity to see ground finches, pelicans, frigate birds and the sea lions.&#xA0; Your Galapagos &#x2018;hosts&#x2019; will be at the dock to welcome you.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;PM:&#xA0; Bah&#xED;a Sullivan, Santiago Island&lt;/em&gt;&#xD;
This site of great geological interest is located southeast of Santiago Island.&#xA0; Anyone interested in volcanology and geology is delighted with the incredible lava formations of Sullivan Bay.&#xA0; The area is covered by lava flows pahohoe type (lava solidified in a corrugated or accordion fashion). Sullivan lava formed in 1897, is geologically a very young flow.&#xA0; The magma formed is flat, but the movement of underground lava, the rapid cooling and other eruptions led to the break in many places.&#xA0; One can observe marine and terrestrial birds, a colony of Galapagos fur seals and black marine iguanas adapted very well to this environment.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Aboard Silversea Silver&lt;/strong&gt;&#xAE; &lt;strong&gt;Galapagos Vessel &#x2013;Verandah Suite (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10, Thu: &#xA0;The Galapagos Islands&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
AM: &#xA0;Galapaguera - Cerro Colorado, San Cristobal Island&#xD;
On the Southeast side of San Cristobal Island in the vicinity of Cerro Colorado, this is one of the few places where you see Calandrinia galapagosa, an endemic plant to San Cristobal in danger of extinction.&#xA0; The site was built in 2002 to increase the population of the giant tortoise population also endemic to San Cristobal, one of the 11 populations of Galapagos land tortoises (Geochelone Chathamensi).&#xA0; It includes 12 hectares/120,000 square meters of dry forest in the area of Cerro Verde.&#xA0; The program yielded its first results in 2005-2006 after the arrival of 11 new members.&#xA0; These tortoises have their corrals at the entrance of the Galapaguera.&#xA0; There is also a small interpretation center where visitors learn about these reptiles, and the conservation and breeding programs.&#xA0; Along the trail you can observe different birds including mocking birds, yellow warblers and small ground finch, tree finch and flycatchers.&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11, Fri:&#xA0; The Galapagos Islands&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
The Twins, Santa Cruz Island&#xD;
The Twins are, geologically speaking, considered as craters despite the fact they were not directly formed by volcanic activity.&#xA0; They are subsidence craters formed by a series of eruptions when the islands were still active.&#xA0; Twins craters are the only place on the island where the Scalesia forest grows.&#xA0; Some species of Galapagos finches and often the beautiful vermilion flycatcher can be seen here.&#xA0; The vermilion flycatcher is the most prominent land bird in the upper parts of almost every island.&#xA0; The Twins are perhaps the best places to see them as they occur in large numbers in the Scalesia forest. &#xA0;Flycatchers are curious and usually pretty tame. &#xA0;They feed on insects, often caught in mid-flight.&#xA0; Another plant that draws attention here is the guayabillo tree, which has clean, smooth bark.&#xD;
&#xD;
PM: &#xA0;Puerto Ayora and Charles Darwin Station, Santa Cruz Island&#xD;
The &#x201C;Charles Darwin Research Station&#x201D; was inaugurated in 1964.&#xA0; It is located next to the Galapagos National Park administration.&#xA0; Both work together developing conservation programs for indigenous and endemic species to the archipelago.&#xA0; The Park Service is the state entity responsible for management and administration of both the land area of the Galapagos National Park and the Galapagos Marine Reserve.&#xA0; The Park Service has to manage and implement programs of protection and conservation of endangered species and work to maintain the ecological integrity of the park in general.&#xA0; There is a souvenir kiosk.&#xA0; Funds raised support conservation and research programs.&#xA0; Here, you see tortoises from different islands.&#xA0; These species are found in large semi natural pens for protection and are divided into four stages:&#xA0; eggs, neonates, juveniles (at the age of being "repatriated"), and adults. &#xA0;It is an excellent place to see finches of several species as well as some xerophytic vegetation.&#xA0; Puerto Ayora, is the most populated village of the island and has the largest port in the archipelago.&#xA0; It offers different activities, restaurants and other amenities.&#xA0; The iguanas rest on the dock while boobies and pelicans dive into the turquoise waters of Academy Bay.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Aboard Silversea Silver&lt;/strong&gt;&#xAE; &lt;strong&gt;Galapagos Vessel &#x2013;Verandah Suite (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Explore Arnhem Land, ancient aboriginal lands that are not accessible by the public.&#xA0; Visitors are able to experience a fascinating mix of traditional and living culture.&#xA0; Arnhem Land is perhaps the one area in Australia where indigenous culture is still dominant, despite a long history of interaction with other cultures such as the Macassens, who came from the Indonesian Island of Sulawesi for more than 500 years to harvest sea slugs.&#xA0; Arnhem Land today has managed to maintain its frontier identity and is the homeland of some 20,000 people.&#xA0; While here, your traditional Aboriginal guide takes you to ancient rock art sites on Injalak Hill (Long Tom Dreaming).&#xA0; This area has some of the finest examples of rock art in Western Arnhem Land.&#xA0; The view from the top of the hill is simply breathtaking, looking out across the floodplains and around the escarpment.&#xA0; Later visit the nonprofit Injalak Art &amp;amp; Craft Centre, where you can do a bit of shopping or just watch traditional aboriginal people paint and women weave pandanus baskets.&#xA0; Travel on to the award winning Davidson's Arnhemland Lodge, situated in the Northwest corner of Arnhem Land and adjacent to Kakadu National Park and Coburg Peninsular in Australia&#x2019;s Northern Territory.&#xA0; This vast sub-tropical savannah has been described both as a national treasure trove depicting ancient human occupation and as a pristine wilderness hosting myriad ecosystems and wildlife inhabitants.&#xA0; Access to the safari lodge is by 4wd during the dry season (May-October).&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Davidsons Arnhemland Lodge &#x2013;&#xA0; Deluxe Cabin (B,L,D) &#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 12: &#xA0;Barmurru Plains&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today is at leisure or opt for one of the many activities available. &#xA0;The floodplains of the Mary River region form one of the most significant ecosystems in Australia.&#xA0; Dominated by climatic extremes of the tropical monsoon, the wetlands and savannah woodlands that fringe the coastal regions between Darwin and Kakadu National Park host an extraordinary diversity of flora and fauna.&#xA0; Bamurru&#x2019;s team of passionate field guides exhilarating airboat trips on the floodplains, cruises on the Sampan River (April to October) to spot crocodiles, 4x4 safaris, scenic helicopter flights over the floodplains and coastline.&#xA0; For bird watchers, the varied habitats include black soil floodplains, paperbark swamps, savannah woodland, river mangroves and coastal beaches, which result in an extraordinary diversity of bird life.&#xA0; The property is also known for the quality of its barramundi fishing (additional cost).&#xA0; Specialist guides can be arranged for as needed.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Bamurru Plains &#x2013; Safari Bungalow (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About South Africa Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Blyde River Canyon:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;The scenic canyon forms the northern part of the Drakensberg escarpment. &#xA0;It is 26 kilometers/16 miles in length with an average depth of 762 meters/2,500 feet deep. &#xA0;It is one of the largest canyons on earth with lush subtropical foliage, deep cliffs, and geographical features such as God&#x2019;s Window, a point along the escarpment with spectacular views of cliffs that plunge over 700 meters/2,297 feet to the lowveld.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Cape Town, Cape Winelands &amp;amp; Cederberg Mountains: &lt;/strong&gt;Cape Town sits in the shadow of Table Mountain. &#xA0;It has a unique multicultural personality that is an amalgamation of Indonesian, French, Dutch, British and German settlers, Bushman and Khoi tribes and the Bantu tribes from the north.&#xA0; From this energetic mix comes a city alive with possibilities for the traveler to explore from the stylish shops of Victoria &amp;amp; Alfred Waterfront to the colorful Malay Quarter&#x2019;s narrow streets and original buildings, many with facades dressed in vibrant hues. &#xA0;The city&#x2018;s history unfolds around every corner:&#xA0; the Castle of Good Hope, built in 1652, city center&#x2019;s 18th-century buildings. Natural attractions abound, such the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve and Cape Point, with its captivating panoramas of two oceans &#x2013; the Pacific and the Indian.&#xA0; The coast offers wildly scenic landscapes, fishing villages and Boulders Bay with its quirky colony of African penguins. Kirstenbosch Garden is enchanting. &#xA0;Cape Winelands encompasses classic wine estates and well-dressed villages of oak-lined avenues set against the backdrop of the Hottentots Holland Mountains. Paarl, Franschhoek and Stellenbosch form the heart of the Cape Winelands. &#xA0;Franschhoek is also noted for some of the top restaurants in the country. &#xA0;Cederberg Mountains and nature reserve north of Cape Town are noted for dramatic rock formations and San rock art. &#xA0;Found in the caves and overhangs of the area, some of these rock and cave paintings may date back to about 400 BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Eastern Cape &amp;amp; KwaZulu Natal:&lt;/strong&gt; These two provinces offer an array of activities from trekking to big game safaris to beaches.&#xA0; The Eastern Cape encompasses the evergreen Tsitsikamma Forest, the rugged Baviaanskloof Wilderness Area and the arid Great Karoo.&#xA0; Pleasant year-round weather, miles of beach and easy access to a wide range of water sports make this a natural destination for outdoor enthusiasts.&#xA0; KwaZulu Natal supports two natural areas: &#xA0;the iSimangaliso Wetland Park and the uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park, both UNESCO World Heritage Sites and considered wetlands of international importance. &#xA0;Phinda Private Game Reserve is situated in subtropical northern KwaZulu Natal, with close proximity to the warm Indian Ocean. &#xA0;It is an awardwinning game reserve with a strong focus on conservation and community involvement.&#xA0; KwaZulu Natal also has the unspoiled beaches of Maputaland, culture and history of the Natal battlefields.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Family Friendly Malaria-Free Game Reserves &amp;amp; Grootbos Nature Reserve:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Some of South Africa&#x2019;s private game reserves have the benefit of being malaria free, important to families with young children or women who might be pregnant.&#xA0; Madikwe Game Reserve, for example, has lodges that include special safari activities for children such as learning to identify animal tracks. Game viewing includes lion, elephant, rhino, buffalo, cheetah, Cape hunting dog, spotted hyena, giraffe, zebra and antelope. Grootbos is a private reserve renowned for its ecotourism and sustainability practices.&#xA0; It is spectacularly situated on the fynbos and forest clad hills of Walker Bay.&#xA0; Land-based whale watching is good here in season. &#xA0;The reserve&#x2019;s Cape Fynbos Kingdom is a flora&#xD;
biodiversity hotspot with more than 740 different species of plants.&#xA0; Grootbos Nature Reserve has promoted its beauty, interpreted its intricate stories, and developed projects focused on conserving this exceptional natural region.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Garden Route:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;The Garden Route travels through both the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. &#xA0;On its journey between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, it edges along the Indian Ocean coastline where mountains crowd the shoreline, creating dramatic plunging cliffs.&#xA0; And, miles of uncluttered beaches invite leisurely walks. &#xA0;The route meanders through historic towns, alongside lakes and rivers into Tsitsikamma National Park, with its views of the muscular coastline. Ecosystems along the route range from a coastal plateau in a fertile area of lush greenery at the foot of the Outeniqua Mountains to the edge of the Klein Karoo, a semi-arid region with towering mountains and gorges.&#xA0; Oudtshoorn is the center for ostrich farming.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Luxury Trains:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;South Africa is the home of two award-winning trains that offer unsurpassed luxury travel reminiscent of another era. &#xA0;The Blue Train and Rovos Rail are each unique in their own way.&#xA0; Rovos Rail offers a romantic, intimate experience with an &#x2018;old style classic feel&#x2019; while the Blue Train offers similar luxury but with modern touches such as television in the rooms. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s a journey into a timeless world of grace, elegance and romance, where spectacular scenery stirs your imagination and luxurious comfort soothes your body. &#xA0;Sit back, enjoy and relax! &#xA0;Both are exceptional, so the choice is yours.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Private Game Reserves:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;Kruger National Park is one of the largest game reserves in Africa, covering 19,485 square kilometers/7,523 square miles. Adjacent to Kruger are several leading private game reserves including Sabi Sands, Timbavati and Thorybush, which offer excellent game lodges and classic safari experiences. &#xA0;They share open boundaries with Kruger, which is part of the Kruger to Canyons Biosphere, an area designated by UNESCO as an International Man and Biosphere Reserve. &#xA0;Each private reserve has its own distinctive style and personality, but all are powerful models of sustainable tourism in action. &#xA0;The lodges and camps operate using environmentally friendly practices that help reduce any negative impact on the environment. They seek to insure conservation of biodiversity and preservation of the cultural heritage that includes benefits to the original local people.&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Best Times to Travel to South Africa&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Most of South Africa is subtropical, with temperatures warmed by ocean on three sides of the country, and the altitude of the interior plateau.&#xA0; The best time to travel depends on your interests.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Spring lasts August to mid-October. Flowers are best seen August and September. Southern right whales migrate to the bays of the southern coast July to November.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Summer, mid-October to early March, is hot and sunny, with afternoon thunderstorms that clear quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Autumn, mid-March to April, is a favorite time to visit when temperatures are comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Winter, May to July or August, in the Northern provinces is dry and sunny, with crisp days and cold nights;&#xA0; but Cape Town is cool to warm with the possibility of rain.&#xA0; May through August is the prime time for spotting game, when the foliage is less dense. &#xA0;The high mountains in Drakensberg sometimes see snow in winter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Borneo (Indonesian: Kalimantan):&lt;/strong&gt; The island is the third largest in the world. &#xA0;North of Java, it is at the geographic center of Maritime Southeast Asia. The island is divided among three countries: Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia. Approximately 73% of the island belongs to Indonesia. &#xA0;The Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak in the north occupy about 26% of the island while Brunei, located on the north coast, comprises just one percent. &#xA0;Borneo encompasses one of the oldest rainforests in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Diving &amp;amp; Moyo Island:&lt;/strong&gt; Indonesia Archipelago is made up of more than 17,000 islands; most uninhabited. Once on the spice trade routes, they became lost to history. Now they are being rediscovered little by little. Divers come to explore a water world of powerful beauty and biodiversity. The island of Moyo is a nature reserve east of Bali. It is home to a deer sanctuary for the indigenous deer; and its hilly forest shelters seven species of bat as well as monitor lizard, python, macaque monkey and wild boar.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Komodo Island:&lt;/strong&gt; Komodo Island&#x2019;s most famous residents are the remarkable Komodo dragons, the largest monitor lizard on earth. &#xA0;It also inhabits the nearby islands of Rinca and Padar.&#xA0; The great lizard shares the island with wild buffalo, deer, pig and various species of tropical birds such as cockatoo.&#xA0; The island&#x2019;s roughly 2,000 residents are descended from convicts who were exiled to the island and later mixed with islanders.&#xA0; The island Komodo is part of the Lesser Sunda Islands and forms part of the Komodo National Park.&#xA0; The island is a popular destination for scuba diving.&#xA0; Komodo has a pink sand beach, one of only seven in the world.&#xA0; The color comes from a mixture of white and red sand, formed from a type of marine plankton species.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Lombok &amp;amp; Bali With Ubud:&lt;/strong&gt; Lombok is less developed and more rugged than Bali. &#xA0;It has the country&#x2019;s third largest volcano, Mount Rinjani, which is part of national park that counts among its residents rare black ebony leaf monkey, long-tailed gray macaque, Rusa deer, barking deer and a host of birds.&#xA0; Lombok&#x2019;s history is seen in Ampenana&#x2019;s grand palace and temple, Narmada Water Palace and the Hindu-Muslim Lingsar Temple.&#xA0; Bali sits in the western end of the Lesser Sunda Islands. &#xA0;The town of Ubud retains its identity through distinctive arts, temples and palaces. &#xA0;It was inhabited as far back as the Bronze Age.&#xA0; Megalithic ruins and stepped pyramids were found as well as a giant Bronze Age gong known as &#x201C;Moon of Pejeng.&#x201D; Hindu-Buddhist culture spread through Bali between the tenth and 12th centuries, leading to the establishment of temples and monasteries. &#xA0;Eloquent Balinese dances, dramas and puppet plays originated in these early kingdoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Sulawesi &amp;amp; Toraja:&lt;/strong&gt; Sulawesi is one of the larger Sunda Islands, and the world&#x2019;s 11th-largest island. About 127 species here include two types of dwarf buffalo, pig, palm civet, tarsiers and macaque. The settlement of South Sulawesi by modern humans is dated to 30,000 BC. In the 16th century, Makassar was the dominant trading center of eastern Indonesia. The indigenous Toraja people inhabit a mountainous region of South Sulawesi. They are known for elaborate funeral rites, burial sites carved into rocky cliffs, massive peaked-roof traditional houses and colorful wood carvings. Toraja funeral rites are social events. The cliffs at Lemo display ancestral sculptures and hanging graves.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Yogyakarta:&lt;/strong&gt; At the center of the city is the kraton, Sultan&#x2019;s palace, which is surrounded by densely populated residential neighborhoods that occupy land that was formerly the Sultan&#x2019;s sole domain. The core of the modern city is to the north, encompassing the Dutch colonial-era buildings and the commercial district. Jalan Malioboro sports rows of pavement vendors, a nearby market and malls that are the main shopping area for tourists.&#xD;

&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Best Time to Travel to Indonesia&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>Custom Belize Tour</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Belize Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Ambergris Caye:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the largest island in Belize, and San Pedro is the only town on the island.&#xA0; Ambergris Caye has been the hub of Belizean area maritime trade for centuries. &#xA0;Historically, fishing, coconuts and chicle have been the main stays of the economy.&#xA0; The history of the island goes back to the Maya, when Ambergris Caye was a trading post.&#xA0; Excavated sites in the area indicate that the historic Maya population may have numbered 10,000. &#xA0;Today tourism has replaced fishing as the major source of income for islanders although the mahogany skiffs are still in service for charter fishing and diving. &#xA0;The reef is only a quarter mile from the beach of Ambergris Caye making diving easily accessible. Hol Chan Marine Reserve is a ten-minute boat ride from town. &#xA0;The reef&#x2019;s richness reinforces Belize&#x2019;s reputation as one of the premier dive destinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Belize Barrier Reef &amp;amp; Great Blue Hole:&lt;/strong&gt; The longest barrier reef in the Western Hemisphere and one of the longest in the world runs just off the Belize coast.&#xA0; It is part of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, which stretches 900 kilometers/560 miles from the northeast tip of the Yucat&#xE1;n Peninsula to Honduras. &#xA0;The Great Blue Hole is a large submarine sinkhole off the coast of Belize.&#xA0; It is near the center of a small atoll and is circular in shape, over 300 meters/984 feet across and 124 meters/407 feet deep. &#xA0;In 1971, Jacques Yves Cousteau brought his famous ship, the Calypso, here to chart its depths.&#xA0; The Great Blue Hole is a part of the larger barrier reserve, and both are a UNESCO World Heritage Sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Cayo District &amp;amp; San Ignacio:&lt;/strong&gt; Cayo is the largest district in Belize, and home to the national capital of Belmopan. &#xA0;San Ignacio is the district capital. The city sits on the banks of the Macal and Mopan River. &#xA0;A sizable Mennonite farming community resides near San Ignacio. &#xA0;Cayo has remarkable Mayan sites that include Caracol and Xunantunich, which occupies a ridge above the Mopan River just west of the Guatemala border. &#xA0;In Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve is Actun Tunichil Muknal (ATM), part of an extensive cave system that requires visitors to hike through jungle, swim into a cave, and crawl through tunnels to reach a preserved Mayan site.&#xA0; Nearby ruins include Cahal Pech, El Pilar and Tikal.&#xA0; Activities include canoeing the cave systems, exploring ancient ruins on horseback and mountain biking.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Duende Cave:&lt;/strong&gt; The Mayan ruins found in Duende Cave are far off the beaten path. These ruins are accessed via rough dirt roads, passing through two established Maya villages; followed by a hike along jungle trails. Entering this cave was, for ancient Mayans, a journey into their underworld, known as Xibalba. Visitors, with their expert guide, climb cave walls and squeeze though slim spaces to view extremely old Mayan pottery and skeletal remains as well as impressive stalagmite curtains.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Hopkins:&lt;/strong&gt; On the east coast of Belize, this casual beachfront town is home to a distinctive cultural tradition &#x2013; the Garifuna, who came from the Caribbean to Central America in the 1800s. The economy of this small but vibrant community is based on farming and fishing, and the growing tourist industry. At the Belufuna Women&#x2019;s Group Bakery, local Garifuna women share their history and way of life with visitors. Diving the barrier reef and fishing the clear turquoise waters are top activities here. During the week of the full moon in April, May and June, at Gladden Spit on barrier reef, divers can swim with thousands of whale sharks, the largest fish in the world today, during their annual migration. In the evening, Garifina musicians offer up casual concerts on the beach.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Orange Walk:&lt;/strong&gt; Orange Walk is a district in the northwest with its capital, Orange Walk Town. The ruins of Lamanai, &#x201C;submerged crocodile,&#x201D; feature the Temple of the Masks, with its ruler&#x2019;s throne and an ancient ball court. It had one of the longest occupation spans, with evidence of Mayan life that dates from about 1500 BC through Postclassic (AD 950-1544) and Spanish colonial times (AD 1544-1700). Other Mayan sites include Cuello, Noh Mul and Chan Chich.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Mountain Pine Ridge Reserve:&lt;/strong&gt; Rolling pine forest spreads over smooth granite hillsides. &#xA0;A huge fire in 1949 caused catastrophic damage, and the combination of this and logging means nearly all the trees are the same age. The reserve has waterfalls, Thousand Feet Valley Falls and King Vulture Falls as well as some unusual habitats such as Baldy Beacon, with soil that cannot support anything but grass so tough that introduced sheep died of indigestion. Rio Frio Caves is the largest accessible limestone cavern in the country. &#xA0;On the border of the reserve, the Mayan site of Caracol dates back to 1200 BC, and artifacts from Barton Creek Cave suggest that it was used as a ritual site.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Placencia:&lt;/strong&gt; This small town located in the Stann Creek District is the most southern town on the largest peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico.&#xA0; In the 17th century, the area was settled by English Puritans from Nova but the settlement died out during the Central American wars of independence in the 1820s. &#xA0;In 2001, Hurricane Iris hit southern Belize with 145 mph winds causing major damage to nearly 95% of buildings.&#xA0; Now, the town boasts miles of beaches, restaurants, galleries, shops and spa.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Punta Gorda:&lt;/strong&gt; Punta Gorda is in southern Belize. Although the town bears a Spanish name, its inhabitants are mostly English-speaking, primarily of Garifuna, East Indian, and Kriol descent. It was settled by a number of Garifuna emigrants from Honduras in 1823. Activities include sea and river kayaking, fly and sport fishing, snorkeling, diving, swimming, caving and birding.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Tikal, Guatemala:&lt;/strong&gt; Tikal is one of the largest archaeological sites and urban centers of the pre-Columbian Mayan civilization. Part of Guatemala&#x2019;s Tikal National Park, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its ruins encompass over 3,000 structures within 54 square kilometers / 21 square miles. The epic architecture at the site dates back as far as the fourth century BC. Tikal&#xA0;reached its apogee during the Classic Period, 200 to 900. The site was deserted a millennium ago. Tikal, rather like Peru&#x2019;s Inca Machu Picchu, possesses a special combination of magic, mystery and majesty.&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;strong&gt;About Mongolia Travel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Gobi Desert&lt;/strong&gt;: The Gobi is the fifth largest desert in the world. Much of the terrain is not sandy but composed of bare rock. The Gobi was part of the great Mongol Empire, and was known for several important cities along the Silk Road. The Gobi Gurvansaikhan Protected Area was established in 1993 and is the largest national park in the country.&#xA0; The protected area safeguards the Mongolian portion of a largely undisturbed part of the vast Gobi Desert.&#xA0; The park is home to abundant wildlife such as Ibex, Argali, wild donkey, gazelle, vulture, gopher, northern pika, lizards, lynx,&#xA0;Mazalai,&#xA0;Gobi bear and threatened &#xA0;snow leopard.&#xA0; The area is great for wildlife viewing, hiking and mountain climbing.&#xA0; Of its many peaks, canyons, and valleys, one of the province&#x2019;s most revered sites is the IkhBogd Mountain, the highest in the Gobi Altai range at 3,957 meters/12,982 feet. BichigtKhad is a world-class petroglyph site, with rock paintings dating back to the Bronze Age. The nearby Tsagaan Aguior White Cave is believed to be the place of the earliest human inhabitance in Mongolia, with evidence of human presence reaching back 700,000 years. The &#x201C;Flaming Cliffs&#x201D; site is a region of the Gobi Desert where major fossil discoveries were first made by American paleontologist Roy Chapman Andrews in the 1920s. The area is most famous for yielding the first discovery of dinosaur eggs, and later specimens of Velociraptor. Paleontologists have done further excavations in the Nemegt Basin in northwestern Gobi, noted for its fossil treasures,&#xA0; including early&#xA0; mammals, dinosaur eggs, and prehistoric stone implements, some 100,000&#xA0;years&#xA0; old. The Gobi&#x2019;s towering sand dunes of Hongoryn Els run about 797&#xA0;kilometers/60&#xA0;miles alongside the Gobi Altai Mountain range. The &#x201C;Singing Sands&#x201D; reach&#xA0;upwards of&#xA0;183 meters/600 feet. Due to its isolation, the area&#x2019;s beauty has been&#xA0; kept safe for&#xA0; thousands of years.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Hustain Nuruu National Park&lt;/strong&gt;:&#xA0;The park provides refuge for the last&#xA0;remaining species of wild horse &#x2013; Przewalski&#x2019;s horse. Mongolia is one of the last&#xA0;horse-based cultures in the world, and horses remain an important part of Mongolian&#xA0;life and art.&#xA0; The government declared the park a &#x201C;Specially Protected Area&#x201D; in 1993, one&#xA0;year after the reintroduction of the horse to the park. It supports an&#xA0;amazing&#xA0;variety of species, including 459 species of vascular plants, 90 species of moss and&#xA0;33 species of mushrooms. Some 44 different mammals have been recorded, including red&#xA0;deer, Mongolian gazelle, Roe deer, wild boar, wild sheep, Ibex, Mongolian marmots, grey wolves, lynx, Pallas cat, red fox, Corsac fox and Eurasian badger. The 217&#xA0; species of birds include golden eagle, Lammergeier, great bustard, whooper swan, black&#xA0; stork and&#xA0; Daurian partridge. From 16 types of fish to 29 species of grasshoppers, it&#xA0;is little wonder&#xA0;that UNESCO&#x2019;s &#x201C;Man and Biosphere Reserves&#x201D; organization certified the park as a&#xA0;member of the world biosphere network of natural reserves.&#xA0; Within the&#xA0; reserve are also&#xA0; Turkic graves and khun chuluu, stone men - pre-Mongolian stone statues.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Kharakhorum&lt;/strong&gt;: Once the capital of Mongolia, it was established by Chinggis&#xA0; (Genghis)&#xA0; Khan in 1220 in the Orkhon Valley. This was the center of his empire and remained the&#xA0; capital of the United Mongol tribes until the Chinese destroyed it in 1391. Today, only&#xA0;ruins remain of this once vital crossroads on the Silk Road.&#xA0; In 1586, Erdene Zuu, the&#xA0; first Buddhist monastery in Mongolia, was built close by. Vast walls and 108 stupas&#xA0; surround the monastery.&#xA0; It has been a place of Buddhist activity for more than 500&#xA0;years. Still in use today, it carries only the traces of its former glory. &#xA0;But the monastery&#xA0;provides insight into the rich religious and cultural past of Mongolia.&#xA0; The temples feature&#xA0;Buddhas, Buddhist art and architecture.&#xA0; Behind the monastery, archaeologists are&#xA0;excavating the site of Kharakhorum.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Lake Hovsgol&lt;/strong&gt;: The highlight of Mongolia&#x2019;s northern provinces, an alpine region&#xA0; bordering the forests of Siberia, is pristine Lake Hovsgol, known as&#xA0;Mongolia&#x2019;s &#x201C;dark blue pearl.&#x201D;&#xA0; It is the second-most voluminous freshwater lake in Asia, and holds almost&#xA0;70% of Mongolia&#x2019;s fresh water and 0.4% of all the fresh water in the world!&#xA0;&#xA0; And it has&#xA0;some of the purest water on the planet.&#xA0; It is surrounded by several mountain ranges.&#xA0; The surface of the lake freezes completely in winter. Kh&#xF6;vsg&#xF6;l is one of 17 ancient lakes&#xA0;worldwide that are more than two million years old. Not as deep as its sister lake,&#xA0;Lake Baikal, it is part of the Baikal Rift System, which resulted from the&#xA0;collision between&#xA0;India and Asia some 55 million years ago.&#xA0; The area is a national park and considered sacred.&#xA0; The park protects wildlife such as ibex, argali, elk, wolf, wolverine, musk deer,&#xA0;brown bear, Siberian moose and sable.&#xA0; Locals usually have a small ice festival after the&#xA0;new year but before spring.&#xA0; This is still a land rarely visited but those&#xA0;who venture here are richly rewarded with incredible scenery, home visits with traditional&#xA0;nomad families,&#xA0;horseback riding and kayaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Uighur Mongolia&lt;/strong&gt;: Like stepping back in time, this region is home to&#xA0;Mongolia&#x2019;s&#xA0; ancient ethnic groups; and it is explored using tented camps for&#xA0;accommodations.&#xA0; The Altai Mountains, Mongolia&#x2019;s highest mountain range, is the territory of&#xA0;rare and elusive snow leopards and ethnically diverse inhabitants including&#xA0;Uriankhai, Kazakh, Torguud, Zahchin, Ould and Myangad descendants. &#xA0;On the southeastern shore&#xA0;of Lake&#xA0;Durgun, a set of cairns has traditionally served as border markers.&#xA0; It was&#xA0;also the site of sacrifices to the local deities that symbolized the link between the&#xA0;land and the men who occupy it. Lake Durgun is also home to critically endangered saiga&#xA0; antelopes.&#xA0; Chandmana soum is where the ethnic Khalkhas live. They are known to be one&#xA0;of the&#xA0;earliest people to practice traditional throat singing. This unique form of&#xA0;vocalizing is when the singer produces two or three separate vocal lines at the same time. In Uvs&#xA0;Province, areas of the steppe are protected as a UNESCO World Heritage&#xA0;Site. Ubsunur Hollow is a fragile mountain basin on the border of Mongolia and the Republic of Tuva in the Russian Federation, named after Uvs Lake, a large,&#xA0;shallow, saline lake in the basin&#x2019;s center. Here, the world&#x2019;s most northern desert&#xA0;meets the&#xA0;northern hemisphere&#x2019;s most southern tundra zone. Ubsunur Hollow is also a UNESCO&#xD;
World Heritage.&#xA0; The Uighurs lived on Kharkhiraa Mountain in the eighth&#xA0; century,&#xA0;but fled their homeland to settle in areas around modern Xinjiang.&#xA0; They became known&#xA0;as teachers of literacy especially during the rise of the Mongol Empire.&#xA0;&#xA0;A group&#xA0;of&#xA0;Uighurs settled in Tarialan soum around the 15th century.&#xA0; This region offers a wealth&#xA0;of opportunities to learn about lifestyles that are rapidly vanishing in the world today.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Ulaanbaatar&lt;/strong&gt;: The contrast between ancient traditions and the dawning of a&#xA0;21st&#xA0;century democracy is most visible here in the capital city, where&#xA0;traditional gers and&#xA0;Buddhist monasteries coexist with modern high-rises. The city has the&#xA0;country&#x2019;s&#xA0; only international airport and a single international rail line, the northsouth&#xA0;Trans-Siberian railway. &#xA0;It is home to Gandan Monastery, the seat of&#xA0; Buddhism in&#xA0;Mongolia. Woven throughout Mongolia&#x2019;s nomadic cultures are rich Tibetan-Buddhist traditions with ancient Shamanist practices still evident.&#xA0; Buddhist monasteries were either destroyed or converted into museums during the 1930s Stalinist purges. But Gandan Monastery survived as it was used by government officials.&#xA0; Mongolia&#x2019;s spirituality remained strong, and saw resurgence in 1990 when Mongolia became a democracy.&#xA0; At Gandan Monastery, the low tones of horns calling the lamas to the temple are heard throughout the grounds.&#xA0; Visitors can see the lamas&#x2019; daily rituals, including the reading of sutras (teachings of the Buddha).&#xA0; Significant renovation projects are underway at Chenrezi and Kalachakra Temples. The magnificent statue of Migjid Janraisig (&#x201C;the lord who looks in every direction&#x201D;) is a 25-meter/82-foot-high statue, gilded in pure gold and clothed with silk and precious stones that completely fills the biggest of Gandan&#x2019;s temples. The Natural History Museum showcases fossils found in the Gobi, including dinosaur eggs, a duck-billed dinosaur, Stone and Bronze Age&#xA0;artifacts, historical costumes of Mongolia&#x2019;s minority tribes and sacred religious relics.&#xA0;&#xA0;The 18th-century Winter Palace was the home of Mongolia&#x2019;s last king, Javzan&#xA0; Damba Hutagt VIII. Zanabazar Fine Arts Museum features works by Mongolian&#xA0; artists, sculptors and painters as well as rock inscriptions, graphic arts, Buddhist tankas,&#xA0;embroideries, and unique Tsam dancing costumes.&#xA0; The museum was named after the great sculptor and artist of the 17th century, who was also the first theocratic ruler of Mongolia.&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Best Times to Travel to Mongolia&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Winter runs November to February; spring from March to mid-May; summer from mid-May to late August; and autumn September and October.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The cold weather in the far north can last a month or two longer than the desert areas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;The travel season begins in mid-May, when Ger camps start opening.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;July is the peak tourist season. The Gobi can reach 40&#xB0;C/104&#xB0;F this time of year.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;August can see lots of rain in the northern and central areas, while September brings cooler weather to the desert, and a change of colors in the northern forests.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;October is cool with occasional snow flurries up north but is still fine for travel. Weather is changeable at this time so be prepared.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Arrive Bogot&#xE1;, Colombia&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Welcome to Colombia&#x2019;s lively capital city, Bogot&#xE1;, where a representative from Big Five will be waiting to escort you to your hotel. &#xA0;In the center of the financial and commercial center of the city, Hotel Casa Medina is located in one of the most historic and traditional buildings of the city.&#xA0; Due to its historic past, the hotel was declared a monument of cultural interest by the Colombian Ministry of Culture.&#xA0; This honor is given to those monuments that because of their authenticity, originality, aesthetics, design or artistic values represent living testimony of its history and culture.&#xA0; This afternoon, you will meet your archeological specialist guide who will give you an introduction about pre-Inca cultures. &#xA0;You will discover the Gold Museum with its extraordinary selection of pre-Colombian gold work, the largest such collection in the world. &#xA0;It includes the legendary Muisca raft of El Dorado in gold. &#xA0;Only about 6,000 pieces are on display &#x2013; a fraction, of their collection of some 55,000 pieces.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Medina Boutique Hotel &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Bogot&#xE1; / Neiva&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you transfer to the local airport to board your flight to Neiva. &#xA0;Set out on a five-hour drive to San Agustin through the extensive floodplains of the Magdalena River Valley, with elevations from 701 meters/2,300 feet up to 1,730 meters/5,675 feet.&#xA0; Pass by fruit, maize and, of course, coffee plantations as well as fields of rice paddies, cotton and wheat. Along the way, you visit Cacica Gaitana Monument, a statue in honor of a 16th-century Yalcon woman who led the indigenous people of the Upper Magdalena River Valley in armed resistance against the Spanish. You will also get a view of Betania Dam, and stop for &lt;i&gt;achiras huilenses&lt;/i&gt;, a traditional cheese snack and a delicious Colombian coffee. Arriving San Agustin, check into Akawanka Lodge, which is located next to the San Agust&#xED;n Archeological Park, an UNESCO World Heritage Site.&#xA0; This afternoon, you explore the park set in a wild, spectacular landscape. It encompasses the largest group of religious monuments and megalithic sculptures in South America.&#xA0; The region was first inhabited by a mysterious civilization approximately 5,000 years ago. One of the oldest pre-Columbian cultures remains largely a mystery as does their later disappearance centuries before the Spanish Conquistadores. &#xA0;One of the few clues is a number of enormous stone statues in the forms of pumas, snakes, eagles holding snakes, warriors, good and evil, and women in childbirth, some of which weighed up to five tons, and ranged between 1.20 meters/4 feet and 4.25 meters/14 meters tall.&#xA0; Walk on to the ceremonial Fuente de Lavapatas site before heading up the hill to the Lavapatas terrace for remarkable views of the surrounding countryside. &#xA0;You will also visit the small Museo Arqueol&#xF3;gico. &lt;strong&gt;Akawanka Lodge (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: San Agust&#xED;n - Isnos&#xA0; - San Agust&#xED;n&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today, set off for the rural town of Isnos, where you will discover archaeological parks such as the Alto de los &#xCD;dolos, &#xA0;and the Alto de las Piedras.&#xA0; The best-preserved funerary complexes of the Agustinian culture are found at Alto de los &#xCD;dolos, with its sculptures, the presence of sarcophagi and ceremonial baths made from stone and paintings of the statues, the sepulcher and temple walls. Some of the well-preserved tombs show the original paint work and have some of the largest stone figures found so far; the tallest figure measures 7 meters/23 feet.&#xA0; On a small hill a short distance away, the Alto de los &#xCD;dolos Archaeological Park feature four sculptures that have managed to retain the original colors as do the tombs.&#xA0; One figure of a human has enormous canine teeth, and a representation of a character with human and animal features rests on its head. Moving between these sites gives you breathtaking views of the Macizo Colombiano massif and the elegant waterfalls of Salto del Morti&#xF1;o and Salto de Bordones.&#xA0; Enjoy lunch in Isnos before returning to San Agust&#xED;n. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Akawanka Lodge (B,L)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: San Agust&#xED;n / Neiva / Bogot&#xE1;&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Travel back to Neiva to catch your flight to Bogot&#xE1;. Upon your arrival, you are met and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; The remainder of the day is at leisure.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Medina Boutique Hotel (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;b&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Bogot&#xE1; / Quito / San Agustin Callo / Rio Bamba, Ecuador&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you are transferred to the airport for your flight to Quito, Ecuador.&#xA0; After claiming your luggage, you will be greeted by your Big Five Ecuador representative and transferred to San Agustin de Callo for a coffee break.&#xA0; This colonial hacienda was built on the site of an Inca palace, one of the two most important archaeological Inca sites in Ecuador, and the point furthest north from Cuzco of Imperial style construction.&#xA0; This remains a working farm and is owned by the family of a former president of Ecuador.&#xA0; It offers an unrivalled glimpse into Ecuador's rich and colorful past. &#xA0;It has an Inca Chapel with its original 17th century ceiling and perfectly carved Inca volcanic stone walls. Then continue to Riobamba.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hacienda Abraspungo (B,L,D)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6: Riobamba / Devil's Nose / Ingapirca / Cuenca&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Start the day with a notorious and thrilling train ride. &#xA0;It departs early in the morning for a journey through remote highland regions and quaint Indian communities grouped around the many train stations along the way.&#xA0; Just before noon, the train arrives at the most famous part of this trip&#x2026; &#xA0;the dramatic series of switchbacks that drop down to Sibambe and back up to the frontier town of Alausi.&#xA0; Here you will savor lunch before entering the land of the Ca&#xF1;ari Indians and Ecuador's largest archaeological site at Ingapirca (the home of the king).&#xA0; Get a glimpse of this site through a brief introduction to the site by an archeologist guide, and then continue to Cuenca.&#xA0; &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Mansion De Alcazar (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7: Cuenca &#x2013; Ingapirca &#x2013; Cuenca&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning you return to Ingapirca to learn more about the history of this site, which features a&#xA0;mixture of Ca&#xF1;ari and Incan architecture.&#xA0; Its exquisitely carved stones were tightly fitted together like a jigsaw puzzle without the use of mortar as seen in other Incan sites.&#xA0; The most significant building is the ruins of the temple of the sun, an elliptically shaped building constructed around a large rock.&#xA0; The temple was positioned so that during the seasonal solstices, sunlight would fall through the center of the doorway of the small chamber at the top of the temple. &#xA0;Much of this chamber has deteriorated.&#xA0; Long before the Incans, the Ca&#xF1;ari indigenous people settled here. They are particularly noted for their resistance against the Inca Empire but were eventually conquered by the Inca shortly before the arrival of the Spanish. &#xA0;The Incas replaced the Ca&#xF1;ari architecture with their own, but, as was their custom, they absorbed the best achievements of each culture they conquered.&#xA0; In the case of the Ca&#xF1;ari, that was in the fields of astronomy and agriculture. Today, the population of Ca&#xF1;ari, which includes many mestizos, numbers only in the thousands.&#xA0; Return to Cuenca in time for lunch and an afternoon excursion through this charming colonial Andean town, including a visit to the Panama hat factory. &#xA0;The historic center of the city is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Trust Site.&#xA0; The origins of the first inhabitants go back to the year 8060 BC.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Mansion Alcanzar (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8: Cuenca / Cajas National Park / Guayaquil&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Enjoy time outdoors today as you walk through El Cajas National Park set amid strikingly jagged peaks, lakes and lagoons.&#xA0; You may spot some of the large variety of animals, some of which are endemic and/or highly endangered. &#xA0;Among the most prominent are South American condors, of which only 80 remain throughout all of Ecuador; the Curiquinga, a large black and white raptor; and the largest species of hummingbird in the world.&#xA0; Some 157 bird species have been recorded here.&#xA0; Overall, 44 species of mammals have been identified that include opossum, puma, coati, weasel, skunk, fox, porcupine, shrew, rabbits and other rodents. &#xA0;Endemic are the Cajas water mouse and Tate's shrew opossum.&#xA0; At least 17 species of amphibians live around the lagoons in the park.&#xA0; &#xA0;This afternoon, return to Cuenca in time for your flight to Guayaquil.&#xA0; Upon arrival, transfer to your hotel. The remainder of the day is free.&#xA0; &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Hilton Colon Guayaquil (B)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9: Guayaquil / Chiclayo, Peru&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Transfer to the airport for your flight to Chiclayo, Peru. &#xA0;You are welcomed and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; The remainder of the day is at leisure and enjoy the amenities of your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Andina Private Collection Chiclayo (B)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10: Chiclayo &#x2013; Tucume &#x2013; Ferre&#xF1;afe &#x2013; Chiclayo&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After a leisurely breakfast, visit the Tucume Pyramids, dozens of pre-Hispanic pyramids, enclosures and mounds found on the plain around La Raya Mountain. &#xA0;This is the site of Tucume, covering an area of over 540 acres and encompassing 26 major pyramids and platforms. This was a major regional center, maybe even the capital of the successive occupations of the area by the Lambayeque/Sican (1000/1100-1350 AD), Chim&#xFA; (1350-1450 AD) and Inca (1450-1532 AD). &#xA0;Local shaman healers invoke the power of Tucume and La Raya Mountain in their rituals, and local people fear these sites, referring to them as &lt;i&gt;Purgatorio&lt;/i&gt; (purgatory).&#xA0;&#xA0; Enjoy lunch at a local restaurant before continuing to Chiclayo&#x2019;s local market. &#xA0;Often considered the most interesting part of the market is the witchcraft sector that sells trinkets such as animal skulls, incense, lizard skins, skulls, voodoo dolls, snake oils and magic potions. &lt;i&gt;(Note* be careful about buying anything related to animals as you will likely not be allowed to bring it into the US). &lt;/i&gt;&#xA0;Later this afternoon, tour the Sic&#xE1;n Museum in Ferre&#xF1;afe. &#xA0;The museum&#x2019;s focus is on the Sic&#xE1;n culture, who were the first people to discover bronze in northern Peru.&#xA0; In addition, the Sic&#xE1;n Museum has an interesting display of the tombs of the nobility. &#xA0;They buried their dead in unique vertical rooms and surrounded them with large collections of pottery, metal crafts and a wealth of gold objects, Sic&#xE1;n masks and other items.&#xA0; Much of this site was looted over time. &#xA0;The Sic&#xE1;n&#x2019;s roots traced back to the Mochica and other contemporary cultures such as the Cajamarca, Wari and Pachacamac.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Andina Private Collection Chiclayo (B)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11: Chiclayo &#x2013; Sipan, Huaca Rajada &amp;amp; Lampayeque &#x2013; Chiclayo&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, with your specialist guide, visit Huaca Rajada, where, in 1987, a small group of Peruvian archaeologists led by Dr Walter Alva discovered the tomb of an important Moche governor.&#xA0; About 34 kilometers/21 miles southeast of Chiclayo, the tomb was complete with all his attire, riches and his symbols of power. &#xA0;The discovery was world news and is considered to be as important a discovery as that of the tomb of the Pharaoh Tutankhamon.&#xA0; The Lord of Sipan died some 1770 years ago. As sovereign, he was considered a semi god. &#xA0;He lived for about 40 years and was 5.5 feet tall. &#xA0;His rich robes and accessories included necklaces, breastplates, ear spools, nose rings, helmets, bracelets and scepters, mostly crafted in a combination of gold and silver.&#xA0; The Royal Tombs of Sipan Museum provide insight in into this culture.&#xA0; It houses items of exceptional beauty &#x2013; three pairs of turquoise and gold ear ornaments showing ducks, deer and the Lord of Sipan himself, as well as breastplates of delicately threaded shell beads. &#xA0;The necklace contains gold spheres and another of huge peanut shells - ten of which were in silver, ten in gold. &#xA0;The scepter is decorated with an inverted gold pyramid with scenes of human sacrifice. &#xA0;There are also objects in copper, shells and semiprecious stones. &#xA0;The importance of this find is the fact that it was remarkably intact, and the main tomb was found untouched by thieves. &#xA0;Shortly after the discovery of the Lord of Sipan's tomb, Alva and his team found two more tombs, one of a priest and the &#x201C;Old Lord of Sipan.&#x201D; &#xA0;By 2007, more than a dozen tombs had been identified. The importance of this discovery and the need to provide an appropriate place to house the finds led to the construction of the Royal Tombs of Sipan Museum, which opened in 2002 in the city of Lambayeque.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Andina Private Collection Chiclayo (B)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 12: Chiclayo / Trujillo&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you set out to Trujillo, stopping at El Brujo en route. &#xA0;El Brujo Archaeological Complex is an ancient site of the Moche culture and served as a major religious and population center between the first and seventh centuries AD. &#xA0;There are two primary sites of interest: Huaca El Brujo (or Cortada/Partida) and Huaca Cao Viejo (or Huaca Blanca); both &#xA0;built by the Moche between 0-600 AD.&#xA0; Huaca Cao Viejo is famous for its polychrome reliefs and mural paintings, and the discovery of the Se&#xF1;ora de Cao (Cao Maiden), the first known Governess in Peru. &#xA0;An earlier pre-ceramic settlement near the complex is Huaca Prieta.&#xA0; Interestingly, the site revealed evidence of the early domestication of chili peppers. &#xA0;The site was later extended by the Cupisnique culture.&#xA0;&#xA0; The Huaca Temple of the Sun is a scaled pyramid about 43 meters/141 feet tall, which, according to legend, was built in only three days by 250,000 men using about 70 million adobe bricks. &#xA0;It served as a ceremonial site and possibly as an administrative center with housing for the upper class. &#xA0;The Huaca Temple of the Moon, located 500 meters/1640 feet away, is a monument comprised of overlapping temples built during different periods. &#xA0;A tomb was uncovered here with over 40 sacrificed warriors. &#xA0;Atop its strong adobe surface are remains of large multi-colored murals that include the face of the Moche god, Aia Apaek.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Libertador Trujillo &#x2013; (B)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 13: Trujillo&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today, you investigate the site of Chan Chan. &#xA0;The Chimu kingdom, of which Chan Chan was the capital, reached its peak in the 15th century, not long before falling to the invading Incas. &#xA0;The planning of this huge city reflects a strict political and social strategy, marked by its division into nine citadels or palaces that formed independent units. &#xA0;This city made of mud is believed to be the largest in pre-Colombian America as well as one of the biggest of the world.&#xA0; Its importance is comparable to the ancient cities of Egypt, Mesopotamia, India and China. &#xA0;It occupies an area of 15 square kilometers/5.8 square miles and encompasses palaces, temples, squares, ponds, gardens, aqueducts and labyrinths. &#xA0;Its walls are ornamented with beautiful and stylized carved drawings of fish, pelicans, rhombuses, and foxes.&#xA0; You will then visit the Huaca el Dragon.&#xA0;Also called "Huaca del Arco Iris" (rainbow), the archeological Chim&#xFA; center is located a short distance north of Trujillo. &#xA0;This huaca was a ritual, adoration temple and belongs to Chan Chan's citadel. &#xA0;Built of adobe, it is one of the best preserved and most important huacas of Peru. &#xA0;Beautiful friezes adorn the walls.&#xA0; Enjoy lunch at Huanchaco Beach. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Hotel Libertador Trujillo &#x2013; Suite (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 14: Trujillo / Lima Depart&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;Upon arrival into Livingstone Airport, you are met and transferred by road to Tongabezi Lodge in Livingstone where you will stay for two nights in a Tongabezi House. Tongabezi Lodge is an exclusive lodge away from the crowds on the banks of the Zambezi River, 15 km upstream from the magnificent Victoria Falls. &#xA0;It is a small and secluded lodge, set in a tranquil grove of African ebony trees on a sweeping bend of the Zambezi River. It accommodates 18 guests and consists of five cottages and four spacious, open-planned stone and thatch houses. All rooms have fabulous river views and en-suite bathrooms.&#xA0;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Each house and cottage at Tongabezi has valet service for the duration of the guests&#x2019; stay; and each valet has in-depth knowledge of Tongabezi and the surrounding area.

&lt;/b&gt;Following the morning activity (time permitting) and breakfast, guests will be transferred by road to Kasane Airport, for their onwards transfer in a light aircraft to Selinda Camp where they will stay for two nights.&#xA0; This&#xA0;intimate camp offers understated luxury on the banks of the eastern Selinda Spillway - a waterway that links Botswana's Okavango Delta to the Linyanti and Kwando marshes, rivers and floodplains.&#xA0; The shaded camp is raised a meter or so off the ground and offers extraordinary views over the floodplains, waterways and wide-open savannas which are only broken by attractive palm islands. It is these views that are one of Selinda's most compelling features.&#xA0; The recently refurbished camp has nine spacious&#xA0;tents under thatch, each with two comfortable three-quarter-sized beds draped with flowing mosquito nets, which add to the romantic atmosphere. The thatch roof combined with ceiling fans and roof vents cool the living space during the hot days. The rooms have spacious, en-suite bathrooms, with full sized stone baths and antique showers. Dual vanity basins complement the sense of luxury and sliding doors allow for privacy or create an open-air bathroom feel as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
Activities in the Selinda Reserve include both day and night game drives in open 4x4 vehicles and game viewing by boat on the Zibalianja Lagoon (subject to water levels). Game viewing is of a high standard, particularly in the drier months and typically seen in the Selinda area are giraffe, baboon, black-backed jackal, elephants, wildebeest, cheetah, crocodile, lion, wild dog, hippo, honey badger, reedbuck, roan, sable and a host of birds. For the more energetic, short guided walking trails are available on request within the vicinity of the camp as well as short mokoro sessions and fishing.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Linyanti area lies to the northeast of the Okavango Delta were the Kwando and Linyanti rivers meet at right angles, forming a swamp area within this triangle.&#xA0; The area's relative remoteness makes it a favored safari destination. The wildlife in the Linyanti area is spectacular and the region is famous for its enormous herds of elephant and buffalo which move down to the Linyanti area at the start of the winter months and only move back inland once the summer rains arrive in November. The Linyanti is also known as one of the best wild dog areas in Africa.&#xA0; The rare dogs start denning anytime from June onwards after which they can usually be found with relative ease for 3-4 months afterwards as they hunt from their den. An abundance of cat species also frequent this area and the birdlife is rich with the best birding months being between October and January. &lt;strong&gt;Selinda Camp - Tent (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 5 &amp;amp; 6:&#xA0;Linyanti Wildlife Reserve / Moremi Game Reserve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/b&gt;After an early morning activity (time permitting) and breakfast, you are&#xA0; transferred from Selinda Camp to Chiefs Camp by light aircraft for the next two nights.&#xA0; You camp&#xA0;is located in the exclusive Mombo concession of the Moremi Game Reserve.&#xA0; The camp is situated on the northwestern tip of Chief&#x2019;s Island, in what is termed seasonal Delta. This concession is revered as one of the region&#x2019;s prime game-viewing destinations and is known as the &#x201C;predator capital&#x201D; of Africa.&#xA0;&#xA0;Twelve luxury tented rooms&#xA0;each offer en-suite facilities and a private balcony.&#xA0; Your comfort is insured with five-star amenities including ceiling fans, mini bars and hair dryers in each room.&#xA0; Electricity is supplied by a combination of a silent packed generator and battery system allowing a 24-hour power supply and communication from the lodge with internet facilities.&#xA0; The main lodge complex houses the dining area, where sophisticated&#xA0;cuisine is served with African &#x2018;flair&#x2019;.&#xA0; There is an elegant bar, curio shop, library, and on the lower deck a large swimming pool with views across the floodplains where you will often see elephants at close range. In addition Chief&#x2019;s Camp features a luxury secluded spa with a full range of treatments, available for an additional charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
Game viewing in the Mombo area of Chief&#x2019;s Island is nothing short of spectacular at any given time.&#xA0; Apart from its predators, the area is also renowned for its large concentrations of plains-game, elephant and buffalo. Game-drives are conducted in open 4x4 safari vehicles and mokoro excursions, depending on water levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
Moremi Game Reserve is a rich and diverse wildlife sanctuary within the great&#xA0;Okavango Delta. The reserve is unfenced and its boundaries are defined naturally by river systems. The vegetation is varied, with dry land complemented by permanent and seasonal swamplands, resulting in an excellent diversity of both wildlife and birdlife.&#xA0; There is a network of game drive routes through the reserve as well as access to the permanent delta waterways in Xakanaxa where boating can be enjoyed (not available from lodges in the Khwai area).&#xA0;&#xA0; Xakanaxa is home to a resident herd of several hundred buffalo whose range covers the territories of at least four prides of lion, which may often be seen flanking the ever moving herd.&#xA0; Breeding herds of elephant move between their browsing areas in the mopane forests and the fresh water of the Okavango. Red lechwe are one of the more unusual antelope species commonly found here. Game is more concentrated around the permanent water during the dry season (Apr - Oct) with it becoming very hot in the later months. The heronries become active as the migrant birds return to Botswana from September through November, and general bird watching is excellent throughout the summer months. The rainy season (Nov - Apr) invigorates the lush scenery with wild flowers, dramatic thundershowers, spectacular sunsets and the birthing season brings great predator and prey interaction. &lt;em&gt;Please note that activities are restricted within the national park in accordance with government rules and regulations. These include no driving off-road, no walking and no driving after dark.&#xA0; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chief&#x2019;s Camp - Luxury Tented Room&#xA0;(B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 7 &amp;amp; 8: Moremi Game Reserve / Okavango Delta&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After an early morning activity (time permitting) and breakfast, guests will be transferred from Chiefs Camp to Xaranna Camp by private helicopter transfer for a two-night stay.&#xA0; The camp&#xA0;overlooks one of the permanent lagoons of the Okavango Delta in 25 000 hectares of pristine wilderness. &#xA0;The camp boasts breathtaking views of the channel, providing guests with a water and wilderness experience that combines the best of what the Okavango has to offer.&#xD;
&#xD;
The&#xA0;camp is set in pristine wilderness that is shared by only 18 guests. It consists of nine contemporary safari tents, each with breathtaking views, a romantic sala and private plunge pool. All guest areas are carefully positioned to maximize the sweeping view across the water. The intimate guest seating lounge boasts a spacious reading and games area, geared towards gentle relaxation. An al fresco dining deck ensures the perfect backdrop for all meals. You can opt&#xA0;to have refreshments served while lounging on the plump cushions in the comfort of your&#xA0; own tent.&#xD;
&#xD;
Xaranna offers plenty of opportunities to enjoy the delta wilderness, with a selection of game drives, mokoro trips and bush walks available. Huge herds of buffalo, numbering up to 220 individuals from calves to impressive old bulls, are frequently encountered. You&#xA0;experience this irresistible combination of water and wildlife on twice-daily game drives in open 4x4 safari vehicles, mokoro and powerboat excursions. Bush walks provide an opportunity to explore the surrounding areas and encounter animals on foot, while night drives give a fascinating glimpse into the busy nocturnal activities of the Delta.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Okavango Delta is one of the world's largest inland deltas situated in the middle of the largest stretch of continuous sand in the world - the Kalahari basin. This oasis in the middle of the desert is a rich yet fragile ecosystem, providing a life source for an incredible variety of wildlife.&#xA0; A wealth of species have adapted to the contrasting conditions created by living in the harsh Kalahari desert which is transformed annually with the arrival of the delta flood waters originating in Angola.&#xA0; The Okavango wetland encompasses Moremi Game Reserve and surrounding regions divided into&#xA0;private concessions.&#xA0; These concessions are wildlife management areas, carefully administrated to balance the growing community&#x2019;s development and conservation, while empowering citizens through sustainable tourism. Many of the exclusive lodges in Botswana are situated within these concessions in the delta, providing an unparalleled wildlife experience - exclusive and remote, avoiding mass tourism and exploitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Flood levels fluctuate dramatically throughout the year, with high water levels peaking in the central Okavango during the dry winter months and water levels at their lowest during the later summer months, contrary to the seasonal rainfall.&#xA0; The landscape, activities and game viewing vary considerably throughout the delta depending on your location, the season and flood levels. Some areas have larger tracts of permanent dry land which generally means there is more focus on land based activities (game drives) and big game viewing.&#xA0; Lodges situated on islands deep in the delta concentrate more on water activities such as mokoro excursions, walking, boating, fishing and bird watching.&#xA0; Those lodges situated on the outer fringes of the delta, referred to as the 'seasonal' delta, offer varied experiences at different times of the year - more water based during high flood levels and more land based as the flood recedes.&#xA0; Game is more concentrated around the permanent water during the dry season (Apr - Oct) with it becoming very hot in the later months. The heronries become active as the migrant birds return to Botswana from September through November, and general bird watching is excellent throughout the summer months. The rainy season (Nov - Apr) invigorates the lush scenery with wild flowers, dramatic thundershowers, spectacular sunsets and the birthing season brings great predator and prey interaction. &lt;strong&gt;Xaranna Camp - Tent (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you head outside the city to Chamundi Hills, eight hills considered sacred. Chamundi's main hill features a long stone stairway leading to the top of the hill via 1,008 steps.&#xA0; The first 600 steps are steeper than those higher up.&#xA0; En route to the top, you pass the large statue of Nandi the bull that was the vahana (vehicle) of Lord Shiva.&#xA0; You can also drive to the main temple.&#xA0;&#xA0; Then you travel on to Nagarhole.&#xA0; After you check in to your resort, you are free to pursue your own interests, or relax with a massage or other Ayurvedic treatment.&#xA0; Orange County, a luxury resort, was named by &lt;i&gt;National Geographic Traveler &lt;/i&gt;as one of the 25 best ecolodges. &#xA0;The sustainable property works to improve their&#xA0; community by generating greater economic benefits to the local people through employment opportunities, use and promotion of local products, use of local suppliers, le, encourage and provide financial support for economic, social or environmental projects that will benefit local communities, insure that all employees are paid fair wages; and work to insure that products used are not made by child or bonded labor.&#xA0; Kabini also has a successful recycling program that includes early stage waste segregation and state-of-the-art sewage treatment plants.&#xA0; Segregated waste is sorted, removed and sold by locals, who benefit from it economically as much as the resort does ecologically.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Orange Country Kabini &#x2013; (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 15: Nagarhole&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning you set out on a vehicle safari in Nagarhole National Park, accompanied by a naturalist guide.&#xA0; Its ecosystem supports the highest density of herbivores found in Asia.&#xA0; In addition to large herbivores such as the chital, sambar, gaur and Asian elephant, Nagarhole is also home to some of the world&#x2019;s rarest predators such as Bengal tiger, leopard and wild dog.&#xA0; During the summer months, the park has the largest congregation of Asian elephants in the world.&#xA0; Bird watchers enjoy spotting some of the more than 300 species recorded in the region!&#xA0;&#xA0; Depending on water levels, this afternoon you go on a safari by boat on the Kabini River through the park.&#xA0; As your boat slips upstream for the resort, the river separates the Nagarhole National Park from the Bandipur National Park.&#xA0; You may pass Asian elephants peacefully feeding, the marsh crocodile, smooth-coated otter and myriad water birds.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Orange Country Kabini &#x2013; (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 16: Nagarhole&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Continue your exploration of the area on safari or on guided nature walks.&#xA0; You can opt to learn about Asian elephants during an informal talk by a naturalist.&#xA0; Learn about this magnificent animal, its natural history and its long association with man.&#xA0; Meet Meenakshi, the resident elephant, and participate in bathing or feeding Meenakshi.&#xA0; Go on a bird watching trek or relax with a massage or other Ayurvedic treatments.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Orange Country Kabini &#x2013; (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 17: Nagarhole / Bangalore / Depart&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today you are transferred to Bangalore for your onward flight. &lt;strong&gt;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/ul&gt;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Days 1 &amp;amp; 2: Livingstone, Zambia&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to your safari!&#xA0; Upon arrival into Victoria Falls Airport, you are met and transferred by road to Victoria Falls River Lodge, where you will stay for two nights.&#xA0; The lodge is the first private game lodge to be set in the Zambezi National Park.&#xA0; It is situated on the banks of the mighty Zambezi River, just minutes from the Victoria Falls. &#xA0;Spacious tents, standard, twin and family suites, are set right on the banks of the river. Each en suite tent has been decorated in earthy hues and has a freestanding bath, sitting area, indoor and outdoor shower and a private viewing deck, where you spot the exceptional wildlife. The main lodge has an open plan design where guests can sit back and relax, under the shade of the thatched roof, as elephants graze along the river line. The Victoria Falls River Lodge takes relaxation one step further offering a selection of in-room massages, pedicures and manicures.&#xA0; The lodge also has a swimming pool and gift shop.&#xA0; Some of Africa's most amazing animals are right on your doorstep. Elephant, hippo, buffalo, giraffe, zebra, wildebeest, impala and even the occasional big cat can be viewed in the park. The lodge offers two safari options; the first is to take a river cruise along the Zambezi or head out in a land cruiser - day or night - to explore the 150,000 acres that make up the Zambezi National Park. For bird watchers, 415 bird species have been recorded in the park &#x2013; it's a birders haven Victoria Falls town lies on the southern bank of the Zambezi River at the eastern end of the famous falls. &#xA0;It is a lovely tourist town, which is easy to explore on foot. Activities run from the challenge of white water rafting and Bungi jumping, to elephant back safaris and sunset cruises.&#xA0;&#xA0;The Victoria Falls are one of the Seven Wonders of the World and is the largest sheet of falling water on earth.&#xA0; The sheer mass of water cascading down the 100 meter drop across nearly two kilometers&#xA0; a thunderous roar and creates a magnificent spray of water that can be seen for miles. The local name for the falls is 'mosi oa tunya' means'the smoke that thunders'.&#xA0; Access to Victoria Falls is within easy walking distance from the town center. Water flow over the Falls varies throughout the year. The river's annual flood season is February to May when the spray can reach a height of over 400 meters, this is spectacular from above but it makes it very difficult to see the Falls at ground level as it is under a heavy shower/mist. Water levels start dropping in August and are at their lowest October - December when much of the rocky face becomes dry. At times of low water, the falls are best viewed from the Zimbabwe side or from Livingstone Island.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Victoria Falls River Lodge &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 3 &amp;amp; 4: Livingstone / Linyanti Wildlife Reserve, Botswana&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Following the morning activity (time permitting) and breakfast, guests will be transferred from Victoria Falls River Lodge to Kasane Airport by road for a seat in charter transfer to Selinda Camp, your home for two nights.&#xA0; Selinda camp is an intimate camp offering understated luxury on the banks of the eastern Selinda Spillway - a waterway that links Botswana's Okavango Delta to the Linyanti and Kwando marshes, rivers and floodplains. The shaded camp is raised a meter or so off the ground and offers extraordinary views over the floodplains, waterways and wide-open savannas which are only broken by attractive palm islands. It is these views that are one of Selinda's most compelling features.&#xA0; The recently refurbished camp has nine spacious guest tents under thatch, each with two comfortable three-quarter sized beds draped with flowing mosquito nets adding to the romantic atmosphere. The thatch roof combined with ceiling fans and roof vents cool the living space during the hot days. The rooms have spacious, en suite bathrooms, with full sized stone baths and antique showers. Dual vanity basins complement the sense of luxury and sliding doors allow for privacy or create an open-air bathroom feel as well.&#xA0; Activities in the Selinda Reserve include both day and night game drives in open 4x4 vehicles and game viewing by boat on the Zibalianja Lagoon (subject to water levels).&#xA0; Game viewing is fantastic, particularly in the drier months. you will&#xA0;usually see&#xA0;giraffe, baboon, black-backed jackal, elephants, wildebeest, cheetah, crocodile, lion, wild dog, hippo, honey badger, reedbuck, roan, sable and a host of birds. For the more energetic, you can venture out on some of the short guided walking trails near the camp as well as&#xA0;short mokoro sessions and fishing. &#xA0; The Linyanti Wildlife Reserve consists of,250 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of pristine wildlife area, bordered by the Linyanti River in the north and&#xA0;Chobe National Park in the east. North of the Linyanti River lies Namibia's Caprivi strip. The Selinda spillway links the area to the Okavango Delta.&#xA0; The region is one of the least visited and most pristine corners of Botswana, shared by a very small number of camps on private concessions, ensuring that guests are able to view the abundant wildlife exclusively. The Linyanti area is renowned for its predators, in particular &#xA0;the increasingly rare wild dog and this is one of the best areas in Botswana see them. The area&#x2019;s wonderful diversity of habitat includes open grasslands, riverine forest and mopane woodland, which provide a haven for wildlife. The waters of the Linyanti weave their way eastwards towards Chobe, forming a myriad of pools and lagoons favored by hippos, crocodiles and birds. These pools also attract game from the dry lands to the east. These hold the first permanent waters in the rainy season. &#xA0;In the early evening, several breeding herds of elephants usually gather by the pools along the Linyanti with youngsters in tow to enjoy a drink and wallow in the mud holes.&#xA0; In the green season, this is a fantastic area for birding with carmine bee-eaters nesting in the river banks and migrant birds appearing in their thousands. &lt;strong&gt;Selinda Camp &#x2013; Tent (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 5 &amp;amp; 6:&#xA0;&#xA0;Linyanti Wildlife Reserve / Okavango Delta&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Following the morning activity (time permitting) and breakfast, you will be transferred by light aircraft to Baines&#x2019; Camp for the next two nights.&#xA0; Baines&#x2019; Camp, named after the famed nineteenth century explorer and artist Thomas Baines, is the banks of the Boro River, in a 260,000-acre private concession in the Okavango Delta that neighbors the Moremi Game Reserve.&#xA0; Set among the shady trees and water of the delta, the small and intimate camp features just five luxurious suites set on elevated platforms in the tree line. The elevated suites on wooden decks offer expansive views over the lagoon teeming with life. At this camp, you have the opportunity to sleep under the stars on your fully mobile four-poster bed. The main area features an oversized deck for outdoor dining and offers views over the beautiful lagoon. &#xA0;Relax at the swimming pool with two thatched salas on either side.&#xA0; The area is superb for viewing all animals and bird species. &#xA0;Explore by land in open-sided 4 X 4 vehicles, often into the night to discover nocturnal species.&#xA0; You can also enjoy water safaris at the gentle pace of a poled mokoro or by safari motorboats (offered most of the year, subject to water levels). For a different perspective, you can go on walking safaris on foot with skilled, armed professional guides. &#xA0;The choice of activities does not stop there.&#xA0; You can also experience the unique and educational elephant interaction, which is an optional activity at an extra surcharge. &#xA0;Pre-booking is recommended for this activity. The Okavango Delta is one of the world's largest inland deltas situated in the middle of the largest stretch of continuous sand in the world - the Kalahari basin. This oasis in the middle of the desert is a rich yet fragile ecosystem, providing a life source for an incredible variety of wildlife. A wealth of species have adapted to the contrasting conditions created by living in the harsh Kalahari desert which is transformed annually with the arrival of the delta flood waters originating in Angola. The Okavango wetland encompasses Moremi Game Reserve, with its private concessions. &#xA0;These concessions are wildlife management areas, carefully administrated to balance the growing community&#x2019;s development and conservation, while empowering citizens through sustainable tourism. &#xA0;Many of the exclusive lodges in Botswana are situated within these concessions in the delta, providing an unparalleled wildlife experience - exclusive and remote, avoiding mass tourism and exploitation. &#xA0;Flood levels fluctuate dramatically throughout the year, with high water levels peaking in the central Okavango during the dry winter months and water levels at their lowest during the later summer months, contrary to the seasonal rainfall.&#xA0; The landscape, activities and game viewing vary considerably throughout the delta depending on your location, the season and flood levels. Some areas have larger tracts of permanent dry land, which generally means there is more focus on land based activities (game drives) and big game viewing. Lodges situated on islands deep in the delta concentrate more on water activities such as mokoro excursions, walking, boating, fishing and bird watching. Those lodges situated on the outer fringes of the delta, referred to as the 'seasonal' delta, offer varied experiences at different times of the year - more water based during high flood levels and more land based as the flood recedes.&#xA0; Game is more concentrated around the permanent water during the dry season (Apr - Oct) with it becoming very hot in the later months. The heronries become active as the migrant birds return to Botswana from September through November, and general bird watching is excellent throughout the summer months. The rainy season (Nov - Apr) invigorates the lush scenery with wild flowers, dramatic thundershowers, spectacular sunsets and the birthing season brings great predator and prey interaction. &lt;strong&gt;Baines&#x2019; Camp &#x2013; Suite (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7: Okavango Delta / Maun / Depart&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Following the morning activity (time permitting), you will be transferred by light aircraft to Maun Airport for their onward travel arrangements. &lt;strong&gt;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

    <tour_highlights>&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Turkey Travel&lt;a href="http://www.bigfive.com/tour/botswana-zambia-three-rivers/new-graphic-sm-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-8533"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8533" alt="New graphic sm" src="http://www.bigfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/New-graphic-sm1.jpg" width="50" height="43" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Ankara&lt;/strong&gt;: Ankara is the capital&#xA0;and&#xA0;second largest city after Istanbul.&#xA0; The oldest settlements in and around the heart of the city date from the Bronze Age.&#xA0; It grew significantly under the Phrygians starting around 1000 BC. The city center sits on a rocky hill, 150 meters/492 feet above the plain.&#xA0; The hill is crowned with the ruins of the old castle.&#xA0; A few historic structures survived around the citadel. Finely preserved ruins of Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine architecture dot the area. The most notable is the Temple of Augustus and Rome, dating from 25 BC-20 BC.&#xD;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antalya&lt;/strong&gt;: Antalya is the largest city on the Turkish Mediterranean coast, and one of the hubs of the Turkish Riviera. Established in 150 BC as Attalia, it has attracted travelers for centuries, including Paul the Apostle. &#xA0;It became a multicultural community of Muslims, Christians and Jews.&#xA0; Nearby are the ruins of Phaselis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bodrum: &lt;/strong&gt;Bodrum has witnessed 3,000 years of history and shows traces of its past everywhere.&#xA0;It is also known for its climate, beautiful sea views, natural beauty and active nightlife.&#xA0;In antiquity, it was known as Halircarnasus, and has been under the influence of many past empires such as Persian, Dorian, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman. Today it is a sailing and vacation destination for those who enjoy the combination of history and amenities offered by resorts. Its cultural events include Ballet Festival in August, and concerts at the Castle or the 2,000-year-old amphitheater.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cappadocia&lt;/strong&gt;:&#xA0; This is an intriguing region of eccentric rock formations, subterranean churches and underground cities.&#xA0; Over millennia, flood waters and wind eroded the land creating fanciful geological creations called fairy chimneys. During the Roman era, Christians sought refuge here.&#xA0; The Open Air Museum of Goreme is a monastic underground complex composed of scores of monasteries placed side-by-side, each with its own church. Most of the churches here belong to the tenth, 11th and 12th centuries. The underground city of Kaymakl&#x131; encompasses prehistoric troglodyte cave-cities that were excavated as early as the Hittite era in the 14th century BC.&#xA0;They were expanded over the centuries and encompass 36 underground cities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eastern Turkey&lt;/strong&gt;:&#xA0; The region encompasses Gaziantep, Kahta, Nemrut, Urfa, Mardin, Van, Kars, Erzurum and Trabzon. Less developed than other areas of the country, it is sprinkled with small villages and farms that still use centuries-old farming techniques.&#xA0; Mount Ararat is the legendary final resting place of Noah&#x2019;s Ark. Ka&#xE7;kar Range north of Erzurum is excellent for trekking, river rafting and for exploring 1,000-year-old churches from the medieval Kingdom of Georgia. Lake Van&#x2019;s is highly alkaline and surrounded by historic towns. The archaeological site of &#xC7;avustepe, dating back almost 3,000 years ago, is nearby. Mt. Nimrod is an artificial mountain framed by two great temples with colossal statues of gods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ephesus&lt;/strong&gt;:&#xA0; From the first century BC, this was one of the great cities of the Greeks in Asia Minor. It was site of the fabled Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world as well as the Celsus Library, Temple of Hadrian and one of the largest ancient theaters in the world. This was a city of intellectual achievements, wealth and splendor.&#xA0; The Ephesus Museum is worth exploring as is Ayios Ionnades Prodomos Church. &#xA0;It is a sacred site for Christians because of its association with several biblical figures, including St. Paul, St. John the Evangelist and the Virgin Mary.&#xA0; The Vatican has recognized a small house in the Solmissos Mountains as the final resting place of the Virgin Mary.&#xA0; The 25,000-seat theater is where St. Paul is said to have preached to the Ephesians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Gulet Cruise&lt;/strong&gt;: Made in Turkey, these graceful, two-mast wooden schooners were long used for transport and fishing along the southern coasts of Turkey. Options include swimming, snorkeling, and kayaking, as well as expeditions onshore. Gulet cruises typically involve a leisurely journey along the coast for about three hours a day on most itineraries, generally by motor, but under glorious sail when time and weather permits!&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Istanbul&lt;/strong&gt;: Originally called Byzantium, the city was renamed Constantinople in the fourth century, and made the capital of the Byzantine Empire. This city is a mesmerizing mix of ethereal minarets, massive mosque domes and modern life from high-rise buildings to cell phones. The old part of Sultanahmen is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and takes in the 2nd-century Roman Hippodrome. Hagia Sophia was an Orthodox basilica, later a mosque, and is now a museum. Famous for its massive dome, this is the epitome of Byzantine architecture and was the largest cathedral in the world for nearly 1,000 years. The captivating Basilica Cistern is thought to have been built in the mid-sixth century. The 17th-century Blue Mosque is one of Istanbul&#x2019;s most prominent landmarks.&#xA0;Topkapi Palace on the acropolis commands an impressive view of the Golden Horn, the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara. The Grand Bazaar, a 540-year-old market, spreads along 64 streets.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Izmir &amp;amp; Sirince&lt;/strong&gt;: On the Aegean Coast in western Turkey, Izmir is an important port and trade center set around a bay and surrounded by mountains. It features thermal spas and sandy beaches. The ancient city of Smyrna is a modern, commercial center with broad boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers that blend with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches. Sirince is a small village famous for its wine and houses.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Konya&lt;/strong&gt;: In central Anatolia, Konya is known as the city of the famous whirling dervishes and for its outstanding Seljuk architecture. Despite rapid growth in recent years, the city retains the air of an Anatolian provincial town.&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Best Times to Travel to&#xA0;Turkey&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Turkey&#x2019;s diverse regions have different climates, with the weather system on the coasts contrasting with that prevailing in the interior.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Spring, April through mid-June, is prime time to visit as the weather is moderate throughout Turkey and the days are long. April can be rainy, but this is high season for Istanbul and Cappadocia, while this is off-season for Aegean and Mediterranean beach resorts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Autumn, mid-September through October, is second best with mostly mild weather, but the days are shorter, and rain may begin again in October.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_name>Ancestor Volcanoes of Guatemala &amp; Galapagos Islands</tour_name>
    <tour_highlights>"I and my family love to participate in active adventures when we travel.&#xA0;&#xA0;This journey makes the most of opportunities for hiking,&#xA0;snorkeling and scuba diving.&#xA0;&#xA0;Hiking up Guatemala's volcanoes is fun, a bit challenging and rewarding when you reach the top.&#xA0; Travelers will be accompanied by a professional volcanologist.&#xA0;&#xA0;For another view, I included a helicopter flight over some of the incredible&#xA0;volcanoes of Guatemala.&#xA0;In&#xA0;the Galapagos Islands, you head in the opposite direction when you snorkel or dive below the surface of the water into a completely&#xA0;different world.&#xA0;&#xA0;The&#xA0;islands are also a result of volcanic activity.&#xA0; It is amazing to realize just how much volcanoes shave shaped much of Latin America."&#xA0;&#xA0; Gisela Polo - Senior Destination Specialist&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bigfive.com/tour/botswana-zambia-three-rivers/new-graphic-sm-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-8533"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8533" src="http://www.bigfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/New-graphic-sm1.jpg" alt="New graphic sm" width="50" height="43" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Explore remarkable volcanoes of Guatemala and the volcanic origins of the Galapagos Islands with specialist guides&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Stroll the charming cobblestone streets of Antigua, a UNESCO World Heritage Site famous for its Spanish Baroque influenced architecture and spectacular ruins of colonial churches&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Hike up Volcan Sierra Negra, the second largest active caldera on the planet; and savor an unusual treat - melting marshmallows with volcanic steam from Pacaya Volcano&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Discover the phenomenal wildlife in Ecuador&#x2019;s famed Galapagos Islands during a four-night land-based journey&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li&gt;Savor amazing aerial views of three volcanoes as your helicopter flies to Lake Atitlan, once called &#xA8;the most beautiful lake in the world&#xA8; by the famous writer Aldous Huxley&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Guatemala City, Guatemala / Antigua&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Guatemala to begin your discovery of some of Central America&#x2019;s active volcanoes. &#xA0;A Big Five representative will greet you when you arrive in Guatemala City, and transfer you by road to your hotel in Antigua. This captivating city is famous for its Spanish Baroque influenced architecture as well as spectacular ruins of colonial churches. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the best-preserved colonial cities in the Americas. Your five-star hotel is a restored Dominican Order monastery that has preserved the treasures from the baroque period while creating a luxurious experience for its guests. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Casa Santo Domingo &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&#xA0; Antigua &#x2013; Pacaya Volcano &#x2013; Antigua&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, your volcanologist guide will meet you in the lobby of your hotel and transfer you to Pacaya Volcano, where you will set out on a hike, about two and a half hours.&#xA0; At the top of the volcano, you will savor a lunch with spectacular views.&#xA0; Active since 1965, this volcano is classified as a strombolian but occasionally plinian. &#xA0;Pacaya recently had a slight increase in volcanic activity, which created several lava rivers. &#xA0;Finish off your meal with a unique dessert &#x2013; marshmallows heated by volcanic steam!&#xA0; Return to Antigua to enjoy an afternoon walking tour of this captivating city.&#xA0; Even Antigua&#x2019;s present location is the result of volcanic activity.&#xA0; It was moved here in 1527 after being destroyed in another location by a volcanic eruption. It has the distinct feel of a place lost in time, from its cobblestone streets to its priceless colonial architecture. There is much to explore here &#x2013; art galleries, museums, shops, restaurants, quaint bars and cafes. &#xA0;The city is also known for its chocolate makers!&#xA0; At the Chocolate Museum &amp;amp; Workshop, you learn how the Mayas used cacao, and you can make your own chocolate.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Santo Domingo (B, L, D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

After breakfast, you are transferred by a 4x4 expedition through forest, communities to a point where you begin your two-to-three-hour trek up the volcano. &#xA0;Acatenango Volcano sits at an altitude of 3,975 meters/13,041 feet, making it the third highest volcano in Guatemala.&#xA0; And, it has the unique characteristic of having an active twin, Fuego Volcano. &#xA0;From the summit of Acatenango, you enjoy lunch surrounded by incredible scenery, and you may see Fuego Volcano explosions. Both volcanoes overlook Antigua and, on a clear day, you may even see the Pacific coastline. After lunch, rendezvous with the vehicle for the ride back to Antigua.&lt;b&gt;&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Casa Santo Domingo (B, L, D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: Antigua &#x2013;Lake Atitlan &#x2013; Antigua&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, travel by helicopter to Lake Atitlan. &#xA0;Its natural beauty, gorgeous views of the volcanoes and indigenous villages caused the famous writer Aldous Huxley to call it, &#xA8;the most beautiful lake in the world.&#xA8;&#xA0;&#xA0; The flight passes over spectacular landscapes including four volcanoes: Fuego (active), Acatenango, Atitlan and Toliman.&#xA0; In sight of three dormant volcanoes, you set out to hike Cerro de Oro, 1,892 meters/6,207 feet, a volcanic formation made by an explosion that occurred millions years ago. &#xA0;Later you enjoy lunch at a local restaurant. Return to Antigua by helicopter.&lt;b&gt;&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Casa Santo Domingo (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Antigua / Guatemala City / Guayaquil, Ecuador&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

This morning, you fly to the famous Galapagos Islands.&#xA0; Your guide meets you at Baltra&#xB4;s airport and drives you through the highlands of Santa Cruz to visit the &#x201C;El Chato&#x201D; reserve.&#xA0; This is the natural habitat of the Galapagos tortoise. &#xA0;Explore the reserve to encounter these lumbering gentle giants and other wildlife such as pintail ducks, egrets, flycatchers, finches, and frigate birds bathing in freshwater lakes. &#xA0;You will also see amazing volcanic tunnels created by hot flowing lava. &#xA0;Continue on to &#x201C;Los Gemelos&#x201D;, two volcanic sinkholes near the top of the island. Walk around these deep craters through a beautiful Scalesia forest covered with epiphytes and ferns.&#xA0;&#xA0;Later in the afternoon, transfer to your accommodations. &lt;strong&gt;Galapagos Safari Camp (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7:&#xA0; Santa Cruz Island - Daily Boat Excursions &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;i&gt;*Depending on the day of the week the excursion to the islands may vary, however, we recommend a &#xA0;visit to Bartholome.&lt;/i&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Bartholome Island and Sullivan Bay (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
The summit trail begins with a dry landing, though sea lions make the dock more exciting.&#xA0; The trail is a dusty walk through volcanic ash. The only vegetation is the &#x201C;pioneer plants&#x201D;, grey Tiquilia and greenish Chamaesyce. These are vital in binding the ash that fans down from the hill. The park wardens have built wooden steps up the hill to prevent further erosion by humans. The reddish spatter cones were minor eruptions of highly viscous material that cooled rapidly. The summit is such a cone; it seems higher than 114 meters/374 feet as you climb the steps.&#xA0; The eastern side has many small lava tubes. If you look carefully, you can make out sunken craters in the sea below. In the distance, you can see most of the central islands, the peaks of Isabela to the west, and, on a clear day, Marchena and Pinta to the north. A good snorkeling place lies at the foot of the Pinnacle Rock that leans into the bay. The cliff is an eroded tuff cone. A small family of Galapagos penguins lives in the shadows of the Pinnacle. You can often spot the penguins on a dingy ride. In the afternoon, return to your tented camp privately nestled on the highlands of Santa Cruz.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Galapagos Safari Camp (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8: Santa Cruz Island / Isabela Island&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, transfer to Baltra&#x2019;s airport to take the interisland flight to Isabela Island.&#xA0; You arrive at your hotel with some time to relax before lunch.&#xA0; This afternoon, visit &#x201C;Las Tintoreras&#x201D;, a set of small islets within the bay. The islets are home to the Galapagos penguin, the only one of this species found in the northern hemisphere. &#xA0;Explore the small, idyllic beaches and coves, and in the offshore waters, you may spot sharks, sea lions, sea turtles and rays. &#xA0;At the end of the day, relax at Puerto Villamil, the island&#xB4;s lazy beach town known for its flamingos and sand streets. &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Iguana Crossing (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9:&#xA0;Isabela Island - Volcan Sierra Negra&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today, you head into Isabela&#x2019;s volcanic highlands on one of the most impressive hikes in the Galapagos. After driving to the end of the road, you begin your hike into a surreal world of volcanic terrain and the flora is sustains. As you hike, you are surrounded by stunning views of volcanoes and the sea. When you arrive at the rim of Volcan Sierra Negra, you are rewarded with a truly one-of-a-kind vista. This is the second largest active caldera on the planet, six miles across at its widest point. Continue your hike along the rim of this enormous crater.&#xA0; The next leg of our hike continues on to the otherworldly landscapes of the secondary vent Volcan Chico, where spectacular lava formations are painted in vibrant hues by sulfur deposits and puffing fumaroles vent volcanic gases. &#xA0;As we head back, we stop for lunch at a restaurant on the slopes of Sierra Negra, which also serves as a private giant tortoise reserve. &#xA0;After spending the day in this volcanic terrain, we take some time to soak up the atmosphere of Puerto Villamil and relax on the beach. &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Iguana Crossing (B, L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10: Isabela Island / Baltra / Guayaquil&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_highlights>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Madagascar Travel&lt;a href="http://www.bigfive.com/tour/botswana-zambia-three-rivers/new-graphic-sm-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-8533"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8533" alt="New graphic sm" src="http://www.bigfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/New-graphic-sm1.jpg" width="50" height="43" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anakao&lt;/strong&gt;: The coastal village and lagoon of Anakao is inhabited by the famous &lt;i&gt;Vezo &lt;/i&gt;fishermen, the semi-nomadic coastal people of southern Madagascar, who depend on the sea. They are skilled fishermen and excellent boatmen. Each canoe is a hollowed tree trunk with one outrigger pole and a small rectangular sail. &#xA0;Both men and women fish. They speak a dialect of the Malagasy language, which is a branch of the Malayo-Polynesian language group derived from the Barito languages, spoken in southern Borneo. They currently live along Madagascar&#x2019;s west coast between Toliara and Mahajanga.&#xA0; This part of Madagascar is the driest of the Island with about only two weeks of rainfall per year.&#xA0; February and March are when cyclones can hit Madagascar and bring rain.&#xA0;&#xA0; The Antandroy and Mahafaly tribe living in this area make their livelihood from small farms and from charcoal production. &#xA0;Here, the cactus fruits and leaves become prime survival foods during the very dry season, both for people and for cattle. Guests here have opportunities to interact with the Vezo during snorkeling, diving and surfing excursions as well a visit to their village.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antananarivo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;This is the capital and largest city of this island nation.&#xA0; It was a major city long before the colonial era. It was founded as Analamanga around 1625 by a Merina king.&#xA0; It sits more or less in the central part of the island north to south, and in the eastern-central region east to west.&#xA0; It occupies the slopes of a long, narrow rocky ridge, which extends north and south some 4&#xA0;km/2 mi.&#xA0; There was a long line of kings and queens, who oversaw the establishment of schools, a foundry, hospitals, schools, and infrastructure development. The French invaded Antananarivo in 1894, prompting the queen's surrender.&#xA0; The former French residence serves as presidential offices and was renamed Ambohitsorohitra Palace.&#xA0; During the time of French rule, tunnels were constructed through two of the city's largest hills as well as major boulevards and commercial areas.&#xA0; Madagascar became independent in 1960.&#xA0; The city has two forts, and some 5,000 church buildings in the city and its suburbs, including an Anglican and a Roman Catholic cathedral.&#xA0; This is the see city of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Antananarivo. Highlights include the Museum of Ethnology and Paleontology, and Andafiavaratra Palace, which serves today as a museum housing an estimated 1466 objects of historical importance that were rescued from a devastating fire in 1995 fire at the Rova of Antananarivo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambalavao&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;Ambalavao is a small town, typical of the Central Highlands.

Antsirabe has a relatively cool climate and is known for both its industry and the high concentration of pulled rickshaws, &lt;i&gt;pousse-pousses&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;The area was once part of the Kingdom of Andrantsay in the early 1600s until it was incorporated into the Imerina kingdom early in the 19th century. It was a farming region that produced rice, vegetables and fruit. &#xA0;The city was founded by a Norwegian missionary in 1872 as a hill station retreat center because of the cooler climate. The region also has many hot springs.&#xA0; Several buildings in city center date back to the first decades of the 20th century such as the thermal bath center, which opened in 1917; the H&#xF4;tel des Thermes, dating from 1922; the 1923 railway station, and a residence that opened in 1934 for French retirees.&#xA0; Other sights are la St&#xE8;le de l'Ind&#xE9;pendance (the Stele of Independence) on Independence Avenue and the two public markets: Antsenakely and the larger Asabotsy.&#xA0; Nearby, Lake Tritriva is a volcanic lake that fills a crater in an extinct volcano.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;

But Ranomafana is better known for its national park, Parc National de Ranomafana, with its 40,000 hectares/98,842 acres of misty cloud forest with spectacular scenery.&#xA0; The park was established in 1986 to protect two species of rare lemur &#x2013; the golden bamboo lemur and the greater bamboo lemur; however, it also supports a wealth of other mammals.&#xA0; It is accessible by paved road (6-8 hours) from Tana. The facilities are still a bit rugged although more Western-style lodgings are developing such as a new resort and a well-organized information center.&#xA0; The landscape consists of odd-shaped rolling hills, thick with dark-green vegetation, and numerous small streams that turn into waterfalls as they plummet off slate-grey rocks into the rushing Namorona River. It is possible to take a short nighttime walk to observe nocturnal animals around the park.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toliara or Toliary&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Formerly known as Tul&#xE9;ar, this port town on Saint-Augustin Bay serves as the major import and export hub for commodities such as sisal, soap, hemp, cotton, rice, and peanuts. &#xA0;Within this area, there are several species of spiny vegetation that can be found nowhere else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Times to Travel to Madagascar&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Festivals and Special Events&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;While each season has something to offer, the best time to visit Madagascar is probably September-November after the cool, dry winter but before the hot rainy season.&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;Winter is July-August and is the coolest time of year. &#xA0;It is also peak whale watching season in the Bay of Antongil (July-Sept), but many other animals are inactive or hibernating.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;September-December is an excellent time for birding as it is the breeding season.&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;October-November is baby lemur season, and generally mild weather&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;Late January-March is cyclone season, the rainiest time of year as well as the peak season for reptiles and amphibians, and the best time for flowering orchids&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
	&lt;li style="text-align: left;"&gt;April-May is when the rains lessen, leaving the countryside lush and green&lt;/li&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/ul&gt;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Nairobi, Kenya&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to the safari capital of Africa!&#xA0; On arrival in Nairobi, you are met by your Big Five Tours &amp;amp; Expeditions&#x2019; representative after you clear customs.&#xA0; Your guide will assist you with luggage and escort you to the hotel, a peaceful retreat and an icon of Nairobi&#x2019;s historical landscape. &#xA0;On a 567-square meter/140-acre sanctuary, it offers a unique opportunity to meet the resident giraffe, all of whom are the endangered Rothschild species. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Giraffe Manor&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Nairobi&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, relax and, if you like, explore the grounds of the manor, home to an impressive variety of birds. After lunch, you encounter some of the elephants at the Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage overlooking Nairobi National Park. &#xA0;It is administered by the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust.&#xA0; The late David Sheldrick stands out, even today, as one of Africa's most famous and proficient Pioneer National Park Wardens of all time. &#xA0;His wife Daphne Sheldrick was the first person in the world to successfully hand rear newborn African elephant orphans.&#xA0; It took her 28 years of trail and error to find the right combination to keep these fully milk dependent young elephants alive.&#xA0; By the year 2008, the trust had successfully saved and hand-reared over 82 infant African Elephant calves, two from the day of birth. You will meet some of these infants and learn about the tragic circumstances they have survived. When a tiny newborn elephant is orphaned, often its mother and entire family have been killed to serve the ivory trade. It is utterly traumatized and is often found near death. It often takes years of patient devotion to bring these young elephants back from the brink.&#xA0; And not all make it. Big Five supports the Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage and is emotionally connected to their mission. &#xA0;Therefore, we have fostered an orphan in your name, which allows you to visit to be when the general public is not permitted. You will long remember your encounter with these incredibly intelligent and intuitive animals.&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Giraffe Manor (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

The Great Rift Valley spreads out beneath your small plane as you fly into the heart of big game country &#x2013; the magnificent Masai Mara National Reserve.&#xA0; This irreplaceable wildlife sanctuary is home to a staggering number of animals, including a large predator population.&#xA0; Gently rolling grasslands stretch to the horizon, intersected by dark green veins of rich acacia woodland. Siome of the 1985 movie "Out of Africa" was filmed here.&#xA0; On arrival, you are transferred to your luxury tented accommodation, a seasonal luxury tented camp that rests in an exclusive location in the Mara.

Hippo and crocodile are plentiful in the Mara River.&#xA0; Game viewing here is remarkable throughout the year, but few things on this planet can compare with the Mara during migration &#xA0;season.&#xA0; Hundreds of thousands of wildebeest and zebra try to make the dangerous river crossing to complete their 800-mile journey in search of green grass.&#xA0; All thee while, the Mara&#x2019;s amazing predators &#x2013; lion, leopard and cheetah, are waiting and watching.&#xA0; Elephant, Cape buffalo and rhinos&#xA0; &#xA0;It is, truly, the greatest show on Earth.&#xA0; Everyone should experience this at least once in a lifetime.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Sala's Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8: Masai Mara National Reserve&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Each day on safari has its own natural rhythm, beginning early morning, with rest in the high heat of day, followed by more activity in the late afternoon into evening.&#xA0; Discover the Mara&#x2019;s vast array of birds from the privacy of your tent or as you lounge in one of the hammocks around camp. &#xA0;Balloon rides are a thrilling way to view the animals and enjoy the expanse of the Mara. Balloon rides can be organized at an optional cost (depending on weather). &#xA0;For the bird watchers, more than 450 species of birds inhabit these lands. &lt;strong&gt;&#xA0;Sala's Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Colombo, Sri Lanka / Negombo&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;You are met with a warm welcome and transferred to your hotel in Negombo.&#xA0; You have the option to rest or to visit Negombo City. This is home to the island&#x2019;s largest community of Catholics, a legacy of the Portuguese, who spread Catholicism along the west coast in the 17th century.&#xA0; It was a trading port for the Portuguese and Dutch.&#xA0; This is reflected in its charming churches, some dating back to the 17th century. This evening, you can stroll along the famous Lewis Place street, where there are plenty of pubs and restaurants lining the&#xA0; street offering an array of fresh seafood specialties.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Jetwing Lagoon&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Negombo / Kandanagedara&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, you set out for Kandegedara, site of a charming, family-owned mansion that dates from the 1900s. It is the heart of a vast coconut plantation and has been renovated as a luxurious heritage residence with stunning vistas.&#xA0; The house and large landscaped gardens overlook a working estate. You approach it along a lovely, frangipani-lined drive.&#xA0; After check-in and a short relaxation, you explore the estate. The estate has a large agricultural area of pepper gardens, coconut trees and paddy fields as well as spices, fruits and vegetables that are grown here.&#xA0; Enjoy a bullock cart ride around the estate. &#xA0;Learn about the coconut tree and the many different uses it has by the local people.&#xA0; This afternoon, explore the area outside the estate premises on bicycle or go on a guided village walk. Visit nearby Buddhist temples or other small rural villages in the vicinity. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Horathapola Estate (B,D)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Kandanagedara / Anuradhapura&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Following an early breakfast, you travel to Anuradhapura. En-route, visit Yapahuwa, an ancient fortress and capital dating back to 1301.&#xA0; Like the better known Sigiriya, this rock rising abruptly some 90 meters/295 feet above its surroundings. The citadel is surrounded by moats and ramparts. The ornamental stairway remains the most impressive feature.&#xA0; This afternoon explore the ancient city of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka's first capital city founded in the fourth century BC. &#xA0;It is a model of systematic planning with gardens and reservoirs, indicating a high level of civilization. Places of interest include the Brazen Palace and the Sacred Bo Tree, considered to be the oldest historically documented tree on earth.&#xA0;Tour the Folk Museum in the sacred city close to the archaeological museum. It displays collections of artifacts that relate to the rural life in the North Central Province. &lt;strong&gt;Palm Garden Village (B)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: Anuradhapura / Aukana / Habarana / Sigiriya&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Continue to explore Anuradhapura before driving to Sigiriya. En-route, stop at Aukana Temple, which has a &#xA0;magnificent and well-preserved image of Buddha. It was constructed in the fifth century BC, during the time of King Dhatusena, and stands 13 meters/43 feet high beneath a recently constructed brick shelter, said to be a reconstruction of the &lt;i&gt;image house &lt;/i&gt;that sheltered it 1,000 years ago. The name "Aukana" means "sun eating" and indeed this image is best viewed at daybreak. Arrive at your hotel, where the rest of the day is at leisure.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Aliya Resort &amp;amp; Spa&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(B)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Sigiriya &#x2013; Polonnaruwa&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today, you set out to climb the Sigiriya Rock Fortress, a 200-meter/656-foot high, red stone fortress with its palace ruins. The top of the fortress is reached by a series of about 750 steps. Sigiriya has long stood as testimony of the genius of ancient Sri Lankan civilization. Built in the fifth century, it is both a monument of architectural ingenuity and historical worth. This legendary citadel atop a massive rock tells tales of power, intrigue and tragedy. Today, Sigiriya is famous for its "mirror wall&#x201D;, so called because of its highly polished surface and its galleries with their pockets of frescoes of lovely maidens done in brilliant tempera on the walls. Then travel on to explore the ancient city of Polonnaruwa, the medieval capital of Sri Lanka. Though smaller in scope, it is said to be aesthetically superior to Anuradhapura. The palaces, shrines, temples and dagobas (stupas) were built by King Parakrama Bahu the Great (1153-1186). Investigate Polonnaruwa Archeological Museum, which is designed in a particular order &#x2013; the citadel, the outer city, the monastery area, the periphery, and Hindu monuments. &#xA0;&#xA0;Later, you have the opportunity to meet and ride on an elephant to tour the small village of Habarana and its surroundings, including a large lake. &lt;strong&gt;Aliya Resort &amp;amp; Spa&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(B)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6: Sigiriya / Dambulla / Kandy&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;On the way to Kandy, you stop to view the Rock Cave Temples in Dambulla. This famous rock cave temple has numerous statues and paintings, 48 of which are of Buddha. The cave's history dates back to the second century BC, and encompasses five caverns.&#xA0;It remains the most impressive rock temple on the island. Arrive at your hotel late this afternoon. In Kandy, visit the mythic Temple of the Tooth, which houses the sacred&#xA0;Tooth Relic of Buddha. &#xA0;The Kandyan Kingdom was established after King Vimaladarmasuriya ascended to the throne in 1592. The king immediately embraced Buddhism and brought the sacred Tooth Relic to Kandy. This evening, enjoy a cultural dance show that highlights this centuries old classical art form.&#xA0;The sensuous, graceful movements of the dancers are enhanced by the brightly colored costumes and the rhythmic music of drummers. &#xA0;A fire-walking show is the highlight of the evening. &lt;strong&gt;Elephant Stables&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7: Kandy / Pinnawela / Kegalle&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today after breakfast, leave for Kegaslle. Along the way you visit the Elephant Orphanage at Pinnawela.&#xA0;At this orphanage, you will find elephants of all ages, which have been abandoned or have injuries that have left them unable to fend for themselves. They are looked after with great care until they are ready to work or be returned to the jungle. The elephants are also bathed daily in a river across the orphanage. &#xA0;The Millennium Elephant Foundation has a museum with displays about the elephants living there as well as exhibits about Asian elephants and the problems they face. This is the only educational resource of its kind in Sri Lanka, and volunteers created most of the displays. You can feed and help bathe the elephants and spend as long as you like watching them.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Rosyth Estate House (B,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8: Kegalle &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Experience life on this small, working estate today.&#xA0; Much hard work has gone into replanting, improving and rejuvenating this plantation.&#xA0; Tea is harvested and sold to the nearby factory, and milky white latex is tapped from rubber trees and sold.&#xA0; You can explore the estate to learn how the women pick tea leaves and visit the local tea factory; or see how rubber trees are tapped.&#xA0; You can also opt to hike to the bottom of the slopes, through tea terraces and rubber fields to discover the small waterfall and local paddy fields where villagers cultivate their rice. The estate also has walking trails and mountain biking routes. &lt;b&gt;&#xA0;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosyth Estate House (B,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9: Kegalle / Kithulgala&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today after breakfast, you drive to Kithulgala via the Galigamuwa-Ruwanwella roadway. Begin your whitewater rafting and cannoning adventure.&#xA0; This activity does not require swimming skill and is great for nearly everyone.&#xA0; The actual run of rapids takes about three to four hours, and encounters grade 2 and grade 3 rapids. Part of this river was used in the filming of David Lean's 1957 award-winning film &lt;i&gt;Bridge on the River Kwai&lt;/i&gt;.&#xA0; The thrills continue if you take the opportunity to go abseiling, also called rappelling, down a rock face, or in this case, the 46-meter/150-foot tall waterfall in Kitulgala.&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0; Royal River Resort (B,D)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10: Kithulgala / Avissawella / Kottawa / Galle / Mirissa &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today, drive toward Mirissa via Avissawella and Kottawa on Sri Lanka&#x2019;s first ever access control highway, the &#x201C;Southern Expressway.&#x201D;&#xA0; This afternoon, visit Galle, an ancient seaport that has been used for centuries by Persian, Arab, Greek, Roman, Malay, Indian and Chinese traders.&#xA0; This southern seaport was under Dutch rule in the 17th century and the town is full of Dutch monuments, ramparts and fort. Galle is also famous for its ebony carving and delicate hand-made lace. In Weligama, you will see stilt-fishermen, whose unique style of fishing involves casting their lines from a perch on a sturdy pole 20-50 meters/ 66-164 feet out to sea. The origin of this type of fishing is lost in history.&#xA0; The stilts are passed on from generation to generation and jealously guarded.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Mandara Resort &amp;amp; Spa (B)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11: Mirissa &#x2013; Unawatuna&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today the morning is at leisure. &#xA0;Later this afternoon, leave for Unawatuna on a snorkeling excursion just south of Galle, about 17 miles from Mirissa. With your qualified Diving Master, you enjoy snorkeling at two prime locations &#x2013; &#x201C;Rock Island&#x201D; and &#x201C;Jungle Beach.&#x201D;&#xA0; Snorkeling gear is provided.

&lt;/b&gt;Early this morning, you embark on an exciting outing in search of whales and dolphins. &lt;i&gt;&#xA0;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Your Breakfast will be served on board the observation ship.&#xA0; &lt;/i&gt;Sri Lanka came within the protected zone in the Indian Ocean declared by the International Whaling Commission in 1979. Out of 81 species of whales, 27 can be seen in the waters around the island as well as several species of dolphins. Whales and dolphins can be found around Sri Lanka between six and eight months a year &#x2013; October to May. Here you will likely see blue, the largest mammals on Earth, humpback and sperm whales as well as Spinner dolphins.&#xA0; Then, drive to Wadduwa.&#xA0; Visit the Turtle Hatchery in Kosgoda to see some of the species that nest here.&#xA0; Several species of turtle, especially the hawksbills, are endangered.&#xA0; Their eggs are most vulnerable to predators. Kosgoda-area fishermen bring these eggs gratis to the hatchery. This has led to the successful hatching and release of more than 100,000 young turtles in the two years since the hatchery opened. Once at your hotel, the rest of the day is at leisure.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;The Blue Water (B)&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/ul&gt;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1, Mon: Arrive Quito, Ecuador&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Ecuador. &#xA0;After claiming your luggage, you are welcomed by your Big Five Ecuador representative and transferred to your hotel situated in a newly restored historic mansion overlooking Plaza San Francisco. &#xA0;The three-story boutique hotel includes 31 rooms of contemporary design accented by antiques, fine furnishings and modern technology.&#xA0; The hotel also has a dining room, glassed-in patio, lush garden, wood-paneled library and a third-floor terrace with panoramic views. &#xA0;The guest rooms are arrayed across all three of its floors, and, due to the property&#x2019;s heritage character, vary in size. All benefit from the mansion&#x2019;s elegant, tall ceilings, drawing the bright Andean sunlight into their interiors. Their decoration plays off rich carpets, towering window frames, flowing curtains and Art Deco-style furniture such as desks, armoires, tables and armchairs. &#xA0;All the rooms are air-conditioned, carpeted, non-smoking and sound proof, with en-suite bathrooms (nearly all with separate bathtubs and showers), and with telephones, intelligent keycards, wireless internet and flat-screen TVs with international cable channels. &#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Gangotena&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2, Tues: Quito - Antisana - Quito&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, you will meet your guide and drive south to the Antisana Ecological Reserve, where you will enjoy a hike to see the famous Andean condors. Enjoy a picnic in the reserve. For centuries the magnificent landscapes around Antisana Volcano were only within reach of scientists, geographers and intrepid explorers. Now, a good paved road takes you into this pristine moorland (paramo), full of wildlife and breathtaking scenery. The Antisana is a Condor Sanctuary, providing refuge for one of the largest concentrations of Andean Condors left in Ecuador, as well as many other rare and endangered highland bird species such as black-faced ibis, cinereous conebills, Andean gulls, brown speckled teal, Andean lapwings, many carunculated caracaras, Andean doves and the rare siskin. The Antisana Ecological Reserve's 296,400 acres include the snow-covered Antisana Volcano, rising to 5758m/18,886 ft. This is one of the most rigorously protected natural areas in Ecuador. The Antisana&#x2019;s massive glaciers feed water to the lakes and rivers of the reserve, which sustain the abundant wildlife of the region, and also provide much of Quito&#x2019;s drinking water. Although condors can be found throughout the Andes cordillera from Tierra del Fuego to southern Colombia, their habitat is shrinking. The bird is the national symbol of Ecuador. Conservation efforts in Ecuador are now underway to save one of the last populations of the world's largest flying bird. What began as a minor movement in local communities is now supported by national non-governmental organizations with international technical and financial assistance. The magnificent condor boasts a wingspan of over 3 meters/10 feet, and has a bare grayish red head with a white ring on its neck. Its feathers are shiny black with white tips.&#x3000; They can easily be seen on a huge wall of cliffs across a narrow canyon on the way up to Antisana or soaring up near the highest peaks. Andean dwellers believed that the condor was a messenger to the gods, which flew into the upper world to carry prayers to the gods. Wear warm clothing and don&#x2019;t forget your binoculars!&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Gangotena (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Delhi, India&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to India. Upon arrival, after clearing your immigration and customs, you will be met by Big Five airport facilitation staff carrying placard of your name in visitor&#x2019;s arrival hall. You are welcomed and transferred to your hotel with necessary assistance. &lt;strong&gt;Lodhi - Lodhi Deluxe Room&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Delhi&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Explore the vibrant city of Delhi, old and new, with its teeming bazaars, British-designed boulevards, modern commercial centers and the powerful reminders of Mughal palaces and forts.&#xA0; Drive past the Red Fort, built in 1648.&#xA0; Board the &#x2018;cycle rickshaw&#x2019; for a unique experience from the Red Fort, through &#x201C;Chandni Chowk&#x201D; or Silver Street, experiencing the sights and sounds of this busy avenue heading west from the Fort. Later, visit the Jama Masjid, the greatest mosque in India. It was completed in 1658 by Shah Jahan, who also built the Taj Mahal and the Raj Ghat, the simple memorial to Mahatma Gandhi. New Delhi offers visits to such sights as the Qutab Minar, 72-meter-high, one of the most perfect towers in the Persian world.&#xA0; The Iron Pillar has survived the vagaries of weather for more than 1500 years.&#xA0; Continue with a drive through Embassy area, the Government buildings (1921-1930) and Connaught Place, the heart and main shopping district of the capital. &lt;strong&gt;Lodhi - Lodhi Deluxe Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Delhi / Jodhpur / Jaisalmer&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today, you catch your onward flight to Jodhpur. Upon arrival, you will be received by our staff and driven to Jaisalmer. Upon arrival, check in to your hotel, a member of The Relais &amp;amp; Ch&#xE2;teaux.&#xA0; The rest of the day is at leisure. A luxury desert camp and spa, The Serai has 21, large canvas tents set on 30 acres of a 100- acre estate of indigenous desert scrub in the Great Thar Desert. &lt;strong&gt;The Serai - Luxury Tented Suite (B)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: Jaisalmer&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Following breakfast, visit the residential portions of a fort where one third of the population of the old city lives. &#xA0;The design of houses echo back a couple of centuries as do the lifestyles of people who live there. &#xA0;Most of the families continue to follow in their families footsteps, which creates a sense of continuity. The houses are arranged in narrow lanes and have small windows.&#xA0; The city is said to be home to the most handsome men and women in Rajasthan.&#xA0; This afternoon, enjoy an excursion into the countryside, visiting typical desert villages, each with a sprinkling of huts. The rough terrain here does not support cultivation, so many in the villages work as causal laborers for road works or community projects. Despite poverty and hard living conditions, the people are friendly and welcoming. Explore the Sam Desert on camelback and watch the dramatic setting sun. &lt;strong&gt;The Serai - Luxury Tented Suite (B)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Jaisalmer / Jodhpur / Mihirgarh&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, you set out by road to Mihirgarh. En route, visit the city of Jodhpur, home of the Rathore rulers of the princely state of Rajasthan.&#xA0; The city is surrounded by a high, 10-kilometer long stone wall, within which stands an imposing fort on a low range of sandstone hills, about 125 meters above the surrounding plains.&#xA0; Mehrangarh Fort, founded in 1459 AD is intricately adorned with long carved panels and latticed windows of exquisite designs in red sandstone.&#xA0; Jaswant Thada is an imposing white marble cenotaph built to commemorate the acts of bravery and generosity of the rulers in 19th century. &#xA0;Then continue to Mihirgarh and your luxury hotel. &lt;strong&gt;&#xA0;Mihir Garh - Suite (B,D)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6: Mihirgarh&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today, you travel to traditional villages to learn something of the lifestyle of local communities, where you are welcomed into the small, mud houses, and meet the turban clad men, and the shy, beautiful women, dressed in customary garb.&#xA0; The market presents a rich display of wares for sale. &#xA0;The remainder of the day you can relax at your hotel, or enjoy activities such as picnics, culinary workshops, or their well-known equestrian program which can be tailored to your interests, including the popular sunrise or sunset rides, as well as full-day rides with overnight in a luxury mobile camp. &#xA0;For the serious rider, there are also extensive three- and four-day riding itinerary with overnights in mobile camps and heritage properties such as Rohet Garh and Fort Chanwa.

&lt;/ul&gt;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Arrive Nairobi, Kenya &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Welcome to the safari capital of the world! After exiting the Customs &amp;amp; Immigrations Hall, please look out for a uniformed Big Five Tours &amp;amp; Expeditions Driver / Guide holding a Big Five Tours sign with your name or tour name on it.&#xA0; Your guide will assist you with your luggage and transfer you to your lodge.&#xA0; The Emakoko is a family-owned and run lodge artfully built into the side of a valley on the Mbagathi River, which borders the Nairobi National Park. The beautifully appointed rooms look out over the game park so one can fall asleep to the sounds of Africa, a lion roaring or the cry of a lone hyena, an amazing contrast to the sounds of traffic, ambulances, fire engines and dogs barking which are the normal sounds of any sleeping city. &lt;strong&gt;The Emakoko &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Nairobi&#xA0;- Nairobi National Park&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Nairobi National Park is managed by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), who, along with the Kitengela Landowners Association (KLA), distribute some of the park&#x2019;s revenues for community projects in the area. There are many issues with wildlife predation on domestic livestock, and the KLA and KWS have an enormous task of managing human-wildlife conflicts. By visiting the Emakoko, you contribute directly to this revenue, which is instrumental in looking after both the community and the park.&#xA0; The Emakoko has supported the local community with the 'lion lighting scheme,&#x2019; one way in which predators have been deterred from attacking the community bomas. The Emakoko is situated on the Nairobi Park boundary and has direct access into the park. The professional guides have a wealth of knowledge on the indigenous flora and fauna. The park is famous for its healthy black rhino population and for its close encounters with lions.&#xA0; In the afternoon, you visit Daphne Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage.&#xA0; The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is a small flexible charity, established in memory of David Sheldrick, famous naturalist and founder warden of Kenya's giant Tsavo East National Park, where he served from 1948 until 1976. The trust works to save the lives of orphaned elephants and rhinos that are ultimately released back into the wild. &lt;strong&gt;The Emakoko (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

This morning, you catch your flight to Loisaba, where you are met at the airstrip and transferred to Sabuk Lodge, your home for the next three nights.&#xA0; Sabuk straddles the border of Laikipia and Kenya&#x2019;s rugged Northern Frontier District.

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 4/5: Laikipia Plateau&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Perched high on the river banks, Sabuk's six cottages are open at the front with sweeping views of the river and cliffs. Each thatched rondavel (circular cottage) has its own unique design crafted from local stone and ancient cedar and olivewood, gathered from the local area. Each cottage is a haven in itself, and offers en suite bathrooms, modern flush toilets and a private verandah with a view.&#xA0; Here you get back to nature with walks along the river, accompanied by the local Laikipiak Maasai guides, who share their vast knowledge, including revealing the traditional uses of the flora in the area.

Alternatively, walking through the African savannah with a Maasai tracker adds an entire new dimension to game viewing. There is also the chance to fly camp.&#xA0; Serian aims to put some adventure into your safari as you walk with experienced guides into the heart of the wilderness. You will immediately notice the difference between a vehicle tour and one conducted on foot. Senses that may have been a little dulled in a car will strain to perceive indications of the wild game that surrounds you. Your perception of the bush will change until you feel an intimate relationship with the environment through which you trek. Walking with Masai Warriors, you will experience the bush in much the same way that our pre-historic ancestors did. At night, you camp under the stars enjoying meals with the voice of the land around you. &lt;strong&gt;Serian Camp (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Following breakfast, visit the residential portions of a fort where one third of the population of the old city lives.&#xA0; The design of the houses echo back a couple of centuries as do the lifestyles of people who live there.&#xA0; Most of the families continue to follow in their families footsteps, which creates a sense of continuity.

It affords very fine view of the lake and the city from the upper terraces.&#xA0; The Jagadish Temple next to the city palace enshrines a dramatic black stone image of Lord Vishnu and a brass image of his vehicle - a mighty bird called Garuda. The temple is an outstanding example of Indo-Aryan Art.&#xA0; Afternoon, enjoy the boat ride on the placid water of Lake Pichola, which is fringed with hills, gardens, havelis, ghats and temples.

The Imperial complex was abandoned in 1585, shortly after its completion, due to lack of water and its proximity regions of increasing turmoil. The profusion of sculpture is breathtaking. Also, the white marble mosque in the secular section is stunning and very sacred. Pilgrims from far and near come to pay their respects.&#xA0; Continue on to Agra, most famous as the site of the fabled Taj Mahal (closed on Friday).&#xA0; This afternoon, you will encounter this monument, constructed by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal "the lady of the Taj".&#xA0; It has been described as the most extravagant monument ever built for love, for the emperor was heartbroken when Mumtaz died after 17 years of marriage, during the birth of her 14th child. The construction began about 1632, employing thousands of artisans and craftsmen, and was completed about 20 years later.&#xA0; The Taj is regarded by many as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a style that combines elements from Islamic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish and Indian architectural styles.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Oberoi Amarvilas - Premier with Balcony (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Day 12: Agra / Delhi / Depart&#xD;

Some 4,000 builders worked on it daily for eight years, completing it in 1573.&#xA0; Later today, you are escorted to Delhi airport in time to connect your onward flight. &lt;strong&gt;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

Nothing evokes the long and intriguing history of Egypt as powerfully as the pyramids. Rising from the desert, Khufu (Cheops), Khafra and Menkaura seem to symbolize the enigmatic tug of Egypt on the imagination. The Great Pyramid of Cheops immortalizes the son of Sneferu and Hetepheres. Though little is known of this pharaoh, his monument, the largest of the three, is comprised of 2.3 million stone blocks, each weighing an average of 2.5 tons. &#xA0;Take in the site of the Great Sphinx, which has stood guard over the pyramids for more than 4,500 years. Carved from an outcrop of rock, the Sphinx remains the ultimate symbol of ancient Egypt with its lion&#x2019;s body and human head. The history and the lives of Egyptian pharaohs come alive through the skilled narrations of your specialist guide. Visit the Solar boat Museum. In 1950, Kamal el-Mallakh an architect and archaeologist, first noticed a thin line of mortar which delineated the edge of a pair of long narrow pits, end to end, on the south side of the Great Pyramid of Khufu. At the time the area was being cleared for a tourist road and when the men dug further they uncovered 41 huge slabs of limestone in the eastern pit (the western one contained 40 slabs) and a mason's mark with a cartouche of Djedefre, Khufu's successor.&#xA0; Next tour the Egyptian Museum that houses the greatest collection of pharaonic items the world. Your guide will lead your through the centuries of treasures, including the Tutankhamen Collection.

&lt;/b&gt;This morning, you fly to Luxor where you board your Nile cruise.&#xA0; Later, you encounter the temples on the East Bank. The Temple of Luxor was built by two pharaohs: Amenhotep Ill and Ramses II. Karnak Temple is a complex of temples, obelisks, pylons, courts, colonnades, halls, reliefs and sanctuaries. The most famous part is the Hypostyle Hall, which contains 134 columns. Karnak was the center of worship of the Sun God Amun. Back aboard your cruise ship, enjoy a buffet lunch and afternoon tea.&#xA0; Later, savor a cocktail reception, dinner and entertainment. &lt;strong&gt;Sonesta St George Nile Cruise (B,L,D)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: Nile Cruise &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today explore the famed Valley of the Kings, where you tour a selection of splendid royal tombs.&#xA0; For nearly 500 years, from the 16th to 11th century BC, tombs were constructed for the kings and powerful nobles of the New Kingdom (the Eighteenth through Twentieth Dynasties of Ancient Egypt) in the alley of the Kings. The valley stands on the west bank of the Nile, across from Thebes (modern Luxor), within the heart of the Theban Necropolis. The wadi consists of two valleys, East Valley (where the majority of the royal tombs situated) and West Valley. The area has been a focus of concentrated archaeological and Egypt logical exploration since the end of the 18th century, and its tombs and burials continue to stimulate research and interest. In modern times the valley has become famous for the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun (with its rumours of the Curse of the Pharaohs), and is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world. In 1979, it became a World Heritage Site, along with the rest of the Theban Necropolis. The valley was used for primary burials from approximately 1539 BC to 1075 BC, and contains some 60 tombs. Nearby, visit some of the intricately decorated tombs in the Valley of the Queens. In ancient times, it was known as Ta-Set-Neferu, meaning, the place of the Children of the Pharaoh, because along with the Queens of the 18th, 19th and 20th dynasties, many princes and princesses were also buried along with a few members of the nobility. &#xA0;Investigate the Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir El-Bahari considered by many to be the finest building of antiquity in Egypt and certainly among the most impressive in the world. The temple is set in a great amphitheater and its three terraces echo the rock formations in the cliff behind. Hatshepsut was the first Egyptian woman to rule as Pharaoh and her reign spanned nearly 20 years. Approached through a sphinx-lined avenue, the temple is entered via monumental ramps that lead to three broad terraces flanked with porticos and rows of Doric columns. Fascinating carved reliefs adorn the second terrace depicting a maritime expedition to the land of Punt (Sudan) and the exotic gifts, such as ivory, ebony, wild cats and incense trees that the Queen of Punt sends back to Egypt. These tombs, ordered by the kings and queens of the New Kingdom, were carved in the rock-faces of the valley to safeguard them against grave-robbers. Sail on to Essna. &lt;strong&gt;Sonesta St George Nile Cruise (B,L,D)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Nile Cruise&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Explore the Temple of Horus in the heart of Edfu. Discovered in the 1860s, this remains the best preserved temple of ancient Egypt. Visit Horus Temple, an ancient Egyptian temple located on the west bank of the Nile in the city of Edfu, which was known in Greco-Roman times as Apollonopolis Magna, after the chief god Horus-Apollo. It is one of the best preserved temples in Egypt. The temple, dedicated to the falcon god Horus, was built in the Ptolemaic period between 237 and 57 BCE. The inscriptions on its walls provide important information on language, myth and religion during the Greco-Roman period in ancient Egypt. In particular, the temple's inscribed building texts provide details of its construction, as well as information about the mythical interpretation of this and all other temples as the Island of Creation. Sail to Kom Ombo to explore the temple shared by two gods Sobek and Haeroris. The building is unique because its 'double' design meant that there were courts, halls, sanctuaries and rooms duplicated for two sets of gods. The southern half of the temple was dedicated to the crocodile god Sobek, god of fertility and creator of the world with Hathor and Khonsu. Meanwhile, the northern part of the temple was dedicated to the falcon god Haroeris, also known as Horus the Elder, along "with Tasenetnofret (the Good Sister, a special form of Hathor) and Panebtawy (Lord of the Two Lands)." The temple is atypical because everything is perfectly symmetrical along the main axis.The temple was started by Ptolemy VI Philometor (180-145 BC) at the beginning of his reign and added to by other Ptolemys, most notably Ptolemy XIII (51-47 BC), who built the inner and outer hypostyle halls. The scene on the inner face of the rear wall of the temple is of particular interest, and "probably represents a set of surgical instruments. Much of the temple has been destroyed by the Nile, earthquakes, and later builders who used its stones for other projects. Some of the reliefs inside were defaced by Copts who once used the temple as a church. All the temples buildings in the southern part of the plateau were cleared of debris and restored by Jacques de Morgan in 1893. A few of the 300 crocodile mummies discovered in the vicinity are displayed inside the temple. Sail to Aswan. This evening enjoy the Galabya Party onboard. &lt;strong&gt;Sonesta St George Nile Cruise (B,L,D)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6: Nile Cruise &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, survey the island temple of Philae, which was nearly lost by the rising waters of Aswan Dams. In a massive effort, it was dismantled piece by piece, and reassembled on the higher ground of Aglka Island.&#xA0; Philae Island was a rocky island in the middle of the River Nile, south of Aswan. It was called in Hieroglyphic "Apo" which means Ivory. It was also known by the Greek "Elephantine," most probably because it was an important centre of trade, especially for ivory. The Ancient Egyptians built a beautiful and magnificent Temple on this island for the Goddess Isis, but the temple became submerged after the first Aswan dam was built in 1906, and it was not until many nations attempted to save the temple in the 1970s. All these countries, together with UNESCO, selected a suitable place, but they had to wait until the completion of the High Dam, in 1971, which would stabilize the level of the water around their chosen island. The granite quarries in Aswan produced all the "red Aswan granite" used in monuments throughout the Nile valley. The quarries aren't that interesting, really, except for the enormous unfinished obelisk that lays in situ on the wall of the quarry. The obelisk was discovered by an Egyptologist named Rex Engel Bach in 1922. The obelisk was roughly finished, but a crack was discovered before it was finished and it was abandoned. This is the largest obelisk ever found -- despite not being erected -- and would have stood about 42 meters high and weighed in at 1168 tons. It was intended as a mate for the obelisk that originally stood at the Temple of Karnak (now in Rome and known as the Lateran Obelisk), but the flaw was too severe. &#xA0;Enjoy a sail on the Nile by traditional felucca around Kitchener's island, named for Lord Kitchener during his military campaigns in the Sudan made the island his head-quarter for his army in 1899. Enjoy a Nubian Folkloric show this evening. &lt;strong&gt;Sonesta St George Nile Cruise (B,L,D)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9: Amman / Petra&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Set out from Amman and travel on to magical Petra, one of Jordan's national treasures and by far its best-known tourist attraction. Located about three hours south of Amman, the rose-red city carved out of a canyon. Petra is the legacy of the Nabateans, an industrious Arab people who settled in southern Jordan more than 2,000 years ago. Admired then for its refined culture, massive architecture and ingenious complex of dams and water channels, this city of stone, once almost lost to time, is now a spectacular UNESCO World Heritage Site. &#xA0;Much of Petra's appeal comes from its spectacular setting deep inside a narrow desert gorge.&#xA0; From the main entrance, the visitor travels on foot through the awesome "SIQ", an immense crack in the sandstone that winds for one kilometer between overhanging cliffs. Petra's most famous monument, the Treasury, appears dramatically at the end of the Siq.&#xA0; As you explore, you see hundreds of buildings, facades, tombs, baths, funerary halls and temples as well as a stunning 3,000-seat theater, which dates from the 1st Century AD. &lt;strong&gt;Movenpick Petra &#x2013; Superior Room (B,L)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10: Petra / Wadi Rum / Dead Sea &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, drive to Wadi Rum. Uniquely shaped massive mountains rise vertically out of the pink desert sand, and offers magnificent desert scenery of strange breathtaking beauty, with towering cliffs of weathered stone. Wadi Rum is probably best known because of its connection with the enigmatic British officer T.E. Lawrence, who was based here during the Great Arab Revolt of 1917-18, and as the setting for the film that carried his name "Lawrence of Arabia". Everywhere in this moonscape place are indications of man's presence since the earliest known times. Drive to Dead Sea hotel for overnight. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Kempinski Dead Sea Resort &amp;amp; Hotel - Ocean View Room (B,L)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11: Dead Sea / Bethany / Madaba /Nebo / Amman / Depart&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;The Jordan Valley has profound meaning religious travelers; the area opposite Jericho has been identified foe nearly two millennia as the area where Jesus Christ was baptized by John the Baptist. Stunning archaeological discoveries between the Jordan River and Tall al-Karrer since 1996 have identified this area as biblical "Bethany beyond the Jordan" where John was living when he baptized Jesus. Then drive to Madaba and Mount Nebo. The trip south of Amman along the 5,000 years old King&#x2019;s Highway is one of the most memorable Journeys in the Holy Land, passing through a string of ancient sites. The first city along the way from the north is Madaba, "The City of Mosaics" which has been&#xA0; inhabited for nearly 3,500 years. The chief attraction in this city is a vivid, 6th century Byzantine mosaic map showing Jerusalem and other holy sites, there are also literally hundreds of other mosaics scattered throughout Madaba is churches and homes. Ten minutes to the west is Mount Nebo, the memorial of Moses, and the presumed site of the prophet's death and burial place then back to Amman Airport for departure with the assistance of Travel Plus representative or guide to finish departure procedures. &lt;strong&gt;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Uaxactun was a major Mayan city just&#xA0;19 kilometers/12 miles north of famous Tikal. Uaxactun was occupied between about 500 BC to AD 889.&#xA0; Its&#xA0;impressive Structre E-VIIsub is&#xA0;the focal point&#xA0;with three temples aligned along its eastern edge.&#xA0; Together these structures were likely used for astronomical studies. The equinox and solstice were accurately determined by sighting the sunrise from the eastern stairway to one of the three pyramids to the east.&#xA0; Watch the sunset with an astronomy specialist. Tonight you will be 'glamping' at Uaxactun.&#xA0; You enjoy a rare opportunity to stay&#xA0;the night in a Mayan archaeological site.&#xA0; After dinner, you spend the night in the middle of the jungle wilderness in a private tent.

Enjoy lunch in route to Lake Atitlan.&#xA0; With three stunning volcanoes (Atitlan, Toliman and San Pedro) rising out of its emerald surface, Lake Atitl&#xE1;n is one of the most beautiful settings in the country.&#xA0;&#xA0;The famous writer Aldous Huxley considered it &#xA8;the most beautiful lake in the world.&#xA8;&#xA0; After check in at your hotel, you have time to relax and enjoy the sunset.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Casa Palopo (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Arrive Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Tanzania! After clearing Immigration and Custom formalities, you are met by a member of Foxes Safari Camp staff holding a name board. They will escort you to your hotel, an oasis of luxury in the very heart of Dar es Salaam. The elegant and cosmopolitan Dar es Salaam Serena is encircled by tropical gardens and is just minutes from the broad sweep of Indian Ocean beaches that characterize this vibrant city. The remainder of the day is at leisure.&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0; Dar Es Salaam Serena Hotel &#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;Please Limit Luggage While On Safari To One (1) Per Person, Max. 32 Lbs. Additional Luggage And / Or Packages May Be Stored At Your Hotel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Dar Es Salaam / Ruaha National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, return to the domestic terminal at the airport for the flight to Ruaha National Park. Landing at the airstrip, you enjoy a game drive through the park to your lodge, which includes only 24 stone chalets spread along the riverbanks, each with river views, spacious interiors and large verandas. Ruaha National Park supports a remarkable number of birds species &#x2013; more than 500. You will also spot both southern and eastern animal species here. Ruaha National Park is the largest Park in Tanzania and lies in the center of the country. This beautiful park has an abundance of wildlife in an array of habitats, which gives the park a character all its own. The great Ruaha River is the lifeline of the park because it is the only permanent water source available.&#xA0; The mid-afternoon break allows you time to relax into the rhythm of the African bush from your veranda at water&#x2019;s edge, or from one of the two bar areas, where you can enjoy watching the animals come to drink at the river.&#xA0; Later in the afternoon, drive to the hippo pool to catch the sunset &#x2013; an incredible end to the day.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt; Ruaha River Lodge (B,L,D)&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 3/4:&#xA0; Ruaha National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Ruaha is not only the largest national park in Tanzania, it also features a well-developed network of roads, which offers a variety of different drives to explore during game drives. A full-day game drive along the river takes you over rocky kopjes, home to the greater kudu, Roan antelope and elephant, and down along the river bank through open plains. On the plains, you find predators such as cheetah and lion, herds of buffalo, families of warthogs, jackals and bat eared fox, among others.&#xA0; The riverbanks are rich with birdsong, often noisy hippos and intimidating crocodiles. Ruaha claims to have more elephants than any national park in East Africa.&#xA0; It is also where you track magnificent mammals like kudu (both greater and lesser), sable and roan antelopes can easily be spotted in Miombo woodland. Male kudus have beautiful spiraled horns while male sable antelopes have impressive curved horns. The park is also a habitat for the very endangered African wild dogs. Other animals in the park include leopards, giraffes, zebras, elands, impalas as well as snakes, monitor lizards and frogs.&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0; Ruaha River Lodge (B,L,D)&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Ruaha National Park / Katavi National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Start early after breakfast to travel to the airstrip for your onward flight to the far west of Tanzania. (Note: these flights only operate on Mondays and Thursdays and the flight time is around 2 hours.) Katavi National Park has the highest concentrations of hippo and crocodiles in Tanzania. Large numbers of animals and few visitors combine for the perfect safari.&#xA0; This truly remote wild park has vast herds of animals grazing the plains.&#xA0; You&#x2019;ll explore the park located along the rift escarpment in western Tanzania. These open expanses turn to swamp during the long rains, but dry out for six months of the year. The animals are concentrated in increasingly smaller area as the park dries out, which means large herds of buffalo, zebra, giraffe and topi, to name a few. The Katuma River shrinks into small pools that become home to ever more hippos in concentrated areas.&#xA0; The dwindling river also exposes caves that crocodiles use to store their prey under water. You may have the opportunity to watch them in these caves, a fascinating experience. The plains are surrounded by woodlands, where the predators lie in wait for their prey to return the grazing lands. Katavi offers a spectacular safari experience.&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0; Katavi Wildlife Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 6/7: Katavi National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Katavi&#xA0;is the third largest national park in Tanzania. It features incredible scenery including immense wetlands, roaring waterfalls and original miombo woodlands, where sable antelopes often hide. During the dry season, huge herds of buffalo, zebras and impalas gather with elephants, waterbucks and duikers around the drying water reserves of Lake Katavi and Lake Chada. You can also observe many animals along the remaining pools of the Katuma River, which are bursting with hippos and crocodiles. Here, at these remaining water sources, the lions, leopards and wild dogs can be found searching for their prey, watched by patiently waiting vultures that share the trees with fish eagles, storks and vervet monkeys.&#xA0; As soon as the first rains begins, Katavi transforms again into a flowering paradise with enormous swamps, lakes, rivers and waterfalls, attracting an incredible diversity of bird life.&#xA0; Each season here has its own special opportunities for interacting with the wilderness.&lt;strong&gt; Katavi Wildlife Camp (B,L,D) &#x2003; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8: Katavi National Park / Dar Es Salaam / Selous Game Reserve&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Depart after breakfast for the flight back to Dar. This flight will stop in Ruaha for refueling. You will arrive in Selous in the mid-afternoon. Selous Game Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is home to a third of the Tanzania&#x2019;s elusive and highly endangered Africa wild dog, and also has the highest number of elephant.&#xA0; The area north of the sprawling Rufiji River is reserved for photographic safaris. The river encompasses wide-open water, lakes and channels, which means that Selous is the only reserve in Tanzania that offers boating safaris in addition to the more classic vehicle and walking safaris.&#xA0; The landscape is predominantly flat and covered with miombo trees. Lions and leopards join the wild dogs as prevalent predators in the reserve that hunt a variety of prey animals from wildebeest and buffalo to smaller animals like warthog and impala. The river supports a rich and varied bird life as well. The riverbanks provide a nesting sites for bee eaters and fishing grounds for kingfishers.&lt;strong&gt; Rufiji River Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 9/10: Selous Game Reserve&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Game viewing in the park include boat, vehicle and walking safaris.&#xA0; In this remarkable park, the only human habitation allowed are limited tourist facilities that are restricted to the top 20% of the reserve. Road access is only possible during the dry season and most visitors fly in from Dar es Salaam by charter aircraft.&#xA0; In the dry season, an ancient migration of elephants takes place between the Selous and Mozambique's Niassa Game Reserves. This is one of the largest natural trans-boundary eco-systems in Africa and at the last census, it was estimated that 64,400 elephants roam the two parks, with 84% on the Tanzanian side.&#xA0; Fierce tiger fish and vandu catfish are caught in the rivers. The latter is equipped with primitive lungs allowing it to cross land for short distance in an attempt to find water during the dry season. The park is home to amazing wildlife from leopard and baboon to Nile crocodile and white rhino, and offers a genuine once-in-a-lifetime safari experience.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt; Rufiji River Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11: Selous Game Reserve / Dar Es Salaam / Depart&#xD;

Upon arrival, you will be met and transferred to San Salvador district, where you pass colorful quinoa cultivated fields in the fertile Urubamba Valley, the Sacred Valley of the Incas.&#xA0; The grain is believed to have been originated in Peru as far back as 5,000 years BCE near Lake Titcaca, and is closely related to species such as beetroots, spinach and tumbleweeds.&#xA0; It is high in protein, lacks gluten, and is tolerant of dry soil.&#xA0; It is cultivated throughout the Andes and, indeed, all over the world today, including the U.S., Europe, Asia and Africa.&#xA0; Urubamba Valley has a large concentration of quinoa plantations.&#xA0; Travel along the Urubamba River to the town of Pisaq and its Indian Market, one of Peru&#x2019;s most famous.&#xA0; Then visit the authentic Calca Andean&#xA0; local market, where&#xA0; Peruvians are actively involved&#xA0; in selling and purchasing Andean crops including quinoa.&#xA0; Savor a late lunch at Huacatay Restaurant with its own special Andean quinoa recipes.

Their remarkable apparel is usually embellished with elaborate, dark colored patterns, which represent the history of their community, and that serve as&#xA0;records of the most important aspects of this rich culture. Hatuncancha sits&#xA0;on the shores of a crystalline stream flowing in the Paramo. In this unique mountain habitat, condors glide on updrafts and llamas and alpacas graze.&#xA0; It is also home to one of the most authentic Quechua-speaking families you will ever meet. They welcome you into their homes as they have done with other travelers since the time of the ancient Incas. You enjoy their hospitality as you learn about their ancient way of life.&#xA0; This is a great opportunity to interact with Hatuncancha families and learn about their connection with quinoa and other &#x2018;lost crops&#x2019; of the Incas.

The ruins are situated on the eastern slope of Machu Picchu in two different areas: the agricultural and the urban. The latter includes the civil sector of dwellings and canals and the sacred sector which includes temples, mausoleums, squares and royal houses.&#xA0; Although constructions show different levels of architecture, religious buildings exhibit a high degree of perfection. The construction was with general use of stone, and the roofs were built of tree trunks and thatched with ichu straw. The walls were made with an inward inclination for protection against earthquakes. You enjoy lunch at Sanctuary Lodge Hotel.&#xA0; Later this afternoon, small buses take you down to Aguas Calientes to the village and check in at your hotel,&#xA0; where you will enjoy a delicious dinner this evening.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Machu Picchu Inkaterra Hotel &#x2013; Superior Deluxe Room (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Day 7: Cusco&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt; High in the Andes, about 3474 m/11,400 feet above sea level, Cusco is considered the oldest continuously inhabited city in the Western Hemisphere.&#xA0; Founded in the 15th century by the Incas, it was later conquered by Spain. Much of the city&#x2019;s architecture reflects the dramatic Spanish style known as Cusco Baroque. The Incas conceived their capital in the shape of a Puma with the river serving as the spine, Sacsayhuaman the head and the main city center the body. You can spot traces of this earlier era&#xA0; in the Incan walls, arches and doorways of almost every central street in the city.&#xA0; Enjoy a half-day visit of this magical city as you drive through the main streets. Visit the Qorikancha (Sun Temple) now referred to as Santo Domingo Church. The curved stonework of the temple is probably unequalled in the world. Imagine walking in to a temple of the time that had stone walls covered with gold!&#xA0;&#xA0; Then, visit the archaeological sites that surround Cusco: the Saqsayhuaman Fortress, an amazing site with huge stone constructions.&#xA0; The site is said to have great cosmic energy, which has lead some to think it was an astronomic observatory and an Inca oracle.&#xA0; Q&#x2019;enqo was used for worship and as a ceremonial center. Enjoy people watching at San Pedro market before heading over to San Blas, the artisan neighborhood of high, narrow streets and a beautiful little plaza.&#xA0; Here, artists create works in textiles, clay and wood.&#xA0; Continue to see the famous Twelve Angles stone, part of the largest Inca wall remaining in Cusco.&#xA0; It once served as the Hatunrumiyoc (Big Stone) palace. This is an example of Inca skill in the use of polygonal masonry.&#xA0; Enjoy lunch at exclusive Inka&#xB4;s Grill Restaurant in Cusco&#x2019;s&#xA0;Main Plaza for another great experience with quinoa recipes. This afternoon is at leisure to pursue your own interests.&#xA0; This evening you dine at Chicha Restaurant, another Chef Gaston restaurant.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Inkaterra &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La Casona&#xA0;Cusco&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; - Suite Balcon (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

This stunning civil engineering achievement by the Inca has been nominated by the American Society of Civil Engineers as a &#x201C;Water Engineering Masterpiece of the Inca Empire.&#x201D; They designed buildings, waterworks, and massive structures to be visually and functionally in harmony with the natural environment.&#xA0; Your guide will take you on a tour of the canals, plazas, aqueducts and fountains.&#xA0; The remainder of the afternoon is at leisure before you savor an exclusive farewell dinner&#xA0;at the hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Inkaterra &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La Casona&#xA0;Cusco&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;- Suite Balcon (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Windhoek, Namibia&#x2019;s capital, nestles among rolling hills, bounded by the Eros Mountains in the east, the Auas Mountains to the south and the Khomas Hochland to the west. It is a meeting place between Africa and Europe, the modern and the old. Well-preserved German colonial buildings are in sharp contrast to the modern architectural styles.

&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you are taken to Eros Airport for your scheduled light aircraft flight to the Wolwedans Dunes Lodge. The scenic flight passes over the central highlands of Namibia and the great Namib Desert to the NamibRand Nature Reserve to land at the lodge airstrip. Upon arrival at the Wolwedans base camp, you are met by a local lodge ranger who takes you to the impressive lodge overlooking the vast plains of the reserve. The rest of the afternoon is at your leisure until you set out on a late afternoon scenic drive.&#xA0; The breathtaking reserve is one of the largest private nature reserves in southern Africa, was began as a conservation initiative in 1984. Today, it extends over 180,000 hectares/445,000 acres of pristine Namib Desert, which was once used for Karakul sheep farming.&#xA0; The reserve shares a part of its border with the Namib-Naukluft National Park to the west, while the imposing Nubib mountain range forms a natural border to the east. The NamibRand possesses a diversity of desert landscapes, with expansive sand and gravel plains and great stretches of grass savannah, the majestic mountain ranges and dune belts of deep red sand. Before NamibRand became a private nature reserve, it consisted of sheep farms, surveyed and allocated in the early 1950s to ex-soldiers of World War II. Today visitors to the Namib Rand can admire nature in its original state, as indigenous animals and plants have been reintroduced.&#xA0; The lodge has nine chalets perched along the top of a dune plateau.&#xA0; The lodge overlooks panoramic vistas in all direction.&#xA0; Its building style is a combination of wooden poles and large canvas blinds/windows that open up to the desert. Each of the nine spacious chalets has an en suite bathroom, and a private veranda looking out over stretches of untouched sand. &lt;strong&gt;Wolwedans Dune Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: NamibRand Nature Reserve &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today, a scenic drive takes you into the unique landscape of the reserve, where you learn about this amazing ecosystem, enjoy the stunning scenery and a picnic lunch before returning to the lodge in the late afternoon.&#xA0; Other activities offered include walking safaris, scenic flights, horseback riding and hot-air ballooning.&lt;strong&gt; Wolwedans Dune Lodge (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: NamibRand Nature Reserve / Damaraland&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After a leisurely breakfast, you return to the airstrip for your scheduled light aircraft flight into the heart of Damaraland. Fly over the famous Sossusvlei Dunes and the great sand sea towards to coast.&#xA0; Weather permitting, you may see deserted mines, shipwrecks and seal colonies along the way to Sandwich Harbour and the port of Walvis Bay.&#xA0; Your plane refuels at the coastal resort of Swakopmundl. Continue north to reach the airstrip at Twyfelfontein, where you will be met by your private, naturalist guide and transferred to Camp Kipwe in time for lunch.&#xA0; The remainder of the afternoon can be spent on a guided excursion to visit the rock engravings at Twyfelfontein, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Strewn over a hillside among flat-topped mountains of red sandstone, the boulders and slabs of red sandstone hold some 2,500 prehistoric engravings that depict wildlife, animal spoor and abstract motifs. It is perhaps the largest and finest collection of petroglyphs in Africa. The engravings show animals such as elephant, giraffe, kudu, lion, rhinoceros, springbok, zebra and ostrich that once used to drink from a fountain at the bottom of the hill. In some cases footprints were engraved instead of hooves or paws. The abstract motifs feature mainly circles. Stone tools and other artifacts found at Twyfelfontein suggest that hunter-gatherers occupied the site over a period of perhaps 7,000 years. A local guide accompanies you to tell the story of this ancient rock art. The engravings lie along two circular routes, one an hour&#x2019;s climb and the other 40 minutes longer. Twyfelfontein is one of Namibia&#x2019;s key National Monuments.&#xA0; Burnt Mountain is a rounded hill a short distance away from Twyfelfontein and the Organ Pipes.&#xA0; It seems to catch fire at sunrise and sunset with a fantastic range of colors due to a chemical reaction that took place roughly 125 million years ago when molten lava penetrated organic shale and limestone deposits, resulting in contact metamorphism. In ordinary sunlight it is a dull black with blackened rubble that lies to one side like cinders from the original fire. Organ Pipes are another geological curiosity in the area consisting of a mass of perpendicular dolerite columns that intruded the surrounding rocks also about 125 million years ago and have since been exposed in a ravine due to river erosion.&#xA0; Your camp is nestled in an outcrop of giant granite boulders. Each comfortable thatched bungalow is simply but tastefully furnished with en-suite open-air bathroom. In the center of the camp lies a large alfresco dining area, bar, lounge and reception with an inviting fireplace nearby to relax beside in the evenings, a refreshing swimming pool and a sunset lookout with lovely views over the landscape.&lt;strong&gt; Camp Kipwe (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Damaraland&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After an early breakfast, you embark on an exciting 4x4 excursion along the ephemeral Aba Huab River Valley to explore this remarkable region and to search for game, especially the elusive desert-adapted elephants, if they are in the area. Damaraland is home to a variety of desert wildlife and hidden treasures. Return to camp for lunch and enjoy some time to relax.&#xA0; Or, your guide can arrange a visit to Twyfelfontein, or you take a walk with your guide&#xA0; in the local area.&#xA0; In habitats with sufficient vegetation and water, an adult elephant consumes as much as 300 kg&#xA0; and 230 liters of water every day of its life. Other large mammals include black rhinoceros and giraffe. Their ranges extend from river catchments in northern Kaokoveld as far south as the northern Namib. Apart from the Kunene River, seven river courses northwards from the Ugab provide them with possible routes across the desert, right to the Skeleton Coast. The biggest are the Hoarusib, the Hoanib, the Huab and the Ugab Rivers.&#xA0; Desert adapted elephant in Kaokoland and the Namib walk further for water and food than any other elephant in Africa. The distances between waterholes and feeding grounds can be as great as 68 km. The typical home range of a family herd is larger than 2,000 km&#xB2;, or eight times as big as ranges in central Africa where rainfall is much higher. They walk and feed at night and rest during the day. To meet their nutritional and bulk requirements they browse on no fewer than 74 of the 103 plant species that grow in their range. Not a separate species or even a subspecies, they are an ecotype unique to Namibia in Africa south of the equator, behaviorally adapted to hyper-arid conditions. Elephant in Mali on the southwestern fringe of the Sahara Desert are the only others known to survive in similar conditions.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0; Camp Kipwe (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6: Damaraland / Etosha National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you will have an early departure&#xA0;as you make your way north deeper into the heart of Damaraland.&#xA0; En route, you will visit an extremely remote Himba village, only known to a few people. Your guide&#x2019;s presence and contacts with the local community&#xA0;insure that you will be welcomed as a &#x2018;friend of a friend.&#x2019;&#xA0;&#xA0;You will have the rare opportunity to spend time with these&#xA0;nomadic pastoralists. &#xA0;There has been virtually no modern influences on these communities, which makes&#xA0;this a fascinating cultural exchange. The Himba, Tjimba and other Herero people&#xA0;inhabit Namibia&#x2019;s remote northwestern Kunene Region, and are loosely referred to as the Kaokovelders. Basically Herero in terms of origin, language and culture, they are semi-nomadic pastoralists who tend to&#xA0;move from one watering place to another, but&#xA0;seldom leave their home territories.&#xA0;&#xA0;They&#xA0;have been little&#xA0;influenced by other&#xA0;cultures and have&#xA0;lived a relatively isolated existence for centuries. The women are noted for their unusual sculptural beauty, enhanced by intricate hairstyles and traditional adornments. They rub their bodies with red ochre and fat, a treatment that protects their skins against the harsh desert climate. Men, women and children adorn themselves with necklaces, bracelets, anklets and belts made from iron and shell beads. With their unusual and striking designs, these items have gained a commercial value and are being produced on a small scale for the urban market. Sculptural headrests in particular are much sought after.&#xA0;A family may move from one home to another several times a year to seek grazing for their goats and cattle. The homes of the Himba of Kaokoland are simple, cone-shaped structures of saplings, bound together with palm leaves and plastered with mud and dung. The men build the structures, while the women mix the clay and do the plastering. You will then continue on your journey, enjoying a picnic lunch en route to your camp on the southern border of Etosha in the late afternoon. &#xA0;The low Ondundozonanandana&#xA0;Mountains serve as a backdrop to the camp in the private Ongava Game Reserve. Bordering Etosha National Park, the Ongava Game Reserve is typified by white calcrete soils, rocky outcrops and scrub-covered plains, which support a rich variety of game such as giraffe, lion, rhino and various antelope species. The camp overlooks a waterhole where guests can enjoy the interaction of wildlife throughout the day and night. &#xA0;The camp&#x2019;s design was guided primarily by the principles of environmental sustainability &#x2013; reduce, reuse, recycle. The old farmhouse now forms the main dining, bar and swimming pool area with guest tents radiating outwards into the secluded mopane woodlands typical of the region. Tents are constructed using a clever mix of calcrete stone cladding, canvas and wood, with double-door entrances and a small verandah that is an extension of the elevated wooden decks. The open-air en-suite bathrooms continue the&#xA0;unique design.&lt;strong&gt; Andersson&#x2019;s Camp (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7: Etosha National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Your&#xA0;morning guided game drive heads into Etosha National Park tracking the wide variety of game and bird species. Etosha National Park covers 22,270 km&#xB2;, of which over 5,000 km&#xB2; is made up of saline depressions or &#x2018;pans&#x2019;.&#xA0; The largest of these pans, the Etosha Pan, can be classified as a saline desert in its own right. The Etosha Pan lies in the Owambo Basin, on the northwestern edge of the Namibian Kalahari Desert. Until three million years ago, it formed part of a huge, shallow lake has been reduced to a complex of salt pans today. The major river that fed it, the Kunene, changed course and began to flow to the Atlantic.&#xA0; If the lake existed today, it would be the third largest in the world.&#xA0; Etosha Pan is the largest of the pans at 4,760 km&#xB2; in extent. Return to the camp for a late lunch and time to relax or take a swim before you head out again for an afternoon game drive.&#xA0; Alternatively, you can opt to spend the whole day out in the park with a picnic lunch one of the waterholes. Enjoy the evening watching animals come to the camp&#x2019;s floodlit waterhole.&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0; Andersson&#x2019;s Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8:&#xA0; Etosha National Park / Windhoek&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast this morning, travel south from the Etosha National Park through the small towns of Outjo and Otjiwarongo before stopping at the Okonjima Day Centre. Here, enjoy a short game drive and educational tour of the AfriCat Foundation in order to learn about the great work being done here in the conservation of Africa&#x2019;s large cats. After lunch at the center, continue to Okahandja to visit the local craft market for some last minute curio shopping, if time allows. Upon arrival in Windhoek your guide will transfer you to your accommodation.&lt;strong&gt; &#xA0;Galton House (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9: Windhoek / Depart&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;You are transferred to the aiport for your departing flight home.&lt;strong&gt; (B)&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Windhoek, Namibia&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today our representative meets you on your arrival at the Windhoek International Airport. You are taken into the city for a short city tour, of Windhoek, Namibia&#x2019;s capital.&#xA0; The city nestles among rolling hills, bounded by the Eros Mountains in the east, the Auas Mountains to the south and the Khomas Hochland in the west. It is an eccentric meeting place between Africa and Europe, the modern and the old. On the main street, you discover well-preserved German colonial buildings are in sharp contrast with modern architectural styles; and see Herero women in their traditional Victorian dresses alongside executives dressed in the latest fashions.&#xA0; You are escorted to your hotel close to Windhoek&#x2019;s city center in the quiet, peaceful suburb of Eros. Set in an olive tree plantation, this new, luxurious hotel provides exclusive suite accommodation with beautiful views over the olive trees towards the Windhoek Mountains. Accommodation is offered in premier suites or junior suites. Premier suites boast their own expansive balcony and plunge pool. All suites have their own lounge area and dining room, giving you the option of enjoying meals in your room, or with other guests for meals at the main restaurant. The en suite rooms offer all the added luxuries of satellite TV, fully-stocked mini-bar, premier wine selection, direct-dial telephone, air conditioner, hair-dryer, wall mounted safe, personal computer for internet access, complimentary wireless internet access, goose-down duvets, 100% cotton linen and style in abundance.&#xA0; The remainder of the day is at leisure.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt; The Olive All-Suite Hotel&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Windhoek / Sossusvlei / NamibRand Nature Reserve &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After breakfast, you are transported to Eros Airport, where you meet your pilot and board your scheduled light aircraft flight to the Sossusvlei area. Upon landing at Sossusvlei Desert Lodge&#x2019;s airstrip, you are met by your local lodge guide.&#xA0; This afternoon, you can opt to explore the NamibRand Nature Reserve, which was begun as a conservation initiative in 1984 and now extends over 180,000ha of pristine Namib Desert. The reserve shares a common border of nearly 100km with the Namib - Naukluft National Park to the west, while the imposing Nubib Mountain range forms a natural border to the east. The particular attraction of NamibRand is its diversity of desert landscapes, representing virtually all facets of the Namib Desert. Expansive sand and gravel plains and endless stretches of grass savannah alternate with majestic mountain ranges and vegetated dune belts of deep red sand. The variety of flora and fauna is as fascinating as the color nuances of the landscape, which change continuously throughout the day.&#xA0; Before NamibRand became a private nature reserve, it consisted of sheep farms, surveyed and allocated in the early fifties to ex-soldiers of World War II. Today, the NamibRand, once used for Karakul sheep farming, has been restored to its natural state and is again home to indigenous animals and plants. You desert lodge is in the northern foothills of the NamibRand Nature Reserve, and designed to make the most of its breathtaking surroundings while providing a sophisticated and luxurious stay. The lodge consists of glass and stone curves, where walls and windows fold away completely to open out to the grassy plains, distant dunes, and mountain ranges. Each spacious, air-conditioned suite features a shaded deck, split-level bedroom and living room with fireplace for cool evenings, en suite glass encased bathroom and outdoor shower. Star gazing is a highlight with a star-viewing sky light in each room and an observatory with a powerful telescope. Guided activities on offer to explore the local reserve include scenic 4x4 nature drives, fascinating walks and exhilarating quad-biking excursions. &lt;strong&gt;Sossusvlei Desert Lodge (B,L,D)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Namib Naukluft National Park&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, you set out early for an excursion into the Namib Naukluft National Park, entering at sunrise to capture the sheer magic of the dunes in the soft morning light and shadows accentuating the shapes and curves of the sand. The park is famous for its towering apricot-colored sand dunes, among the highest free-standing sand dunes in the world measuring up to 300 m/984 ft above their surroundings. Your local lodge guide will give you an insight on the formation of the Namib Desert and its myriad of fascinating creatures and plants that have adapted to survive these harsh environs.&#xA0; Once you have explored the dune fields to your heart&#x2019;s content you can enjoy a relaxing picnic breakfast in the shade of a camel thorn tree. Return to your lodge in the early afternoon for a late lunch, stopping off to view Sesriem Canyon along the way. The rest of the afternoon is at your leisure or you may like to enjoy another guided excursion on the lodge reserve.&#xA0; Until the encroaching dunes blocked its course around 60,000 years ago, the Tsauchab River once reached the sea. Sand-locked pans to the west show where the river previously flowed before dunes shifted its endpoint to where it currently gathers at Sossusvlei. Roughly once a decade rainfall over the catchment area is sufficient to bring the river down in flood and fill the pan. Sossusvlei is the biggest of four pans in the vicinity. Another, famous for its gnarled and ghostly camel thorn trees, is Deadvlei, which can be reached on foot over 1km of sand. Deadvlei&#x2019;s striking camel thorn trees; dead for want of water, still stand erect as they once grew. They survived until about 900 years ago when the sand sea finally blocked the river from occasionally flooding the pan. &lt;strong&gt;Sossusvlei Desert Lodge (B,L,D) &#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: NamibRand Nature Reserve / Damaraland&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After a leisurely breakfast, you are transferred back to the airstrip where you board your scheduled light aircraft flight to Damaraland. The flight route begins with an amazing bird&#x2019;s eye view of Sossusvlei and the great dune sea that stretches to the coast. You then fly north along the coastline (fog permitting) over abandoned mining camps, shipwrecks, Sandwich Harbour, salt pans and Walvis Bay lagoon before you land at Swakopmund Airport to refuel. From there, you continue north and inland into the heart of Damaraland and your camp, set on the rugged the northern slopes of the Huab River. This private paradise offers stunning silence, beauty and tranquility with nine large luxury canvas tents, each with en suite bathroom.&#xA0; The dining room, pub and curio shop are combined under canvas and an open fire is enjoyed close by. On arrival at your camp, you meet your private naturalist guide, who will accompany you for the remainder of your journey. This afternoon, you can either enjoy a walk in the local area with your guide or simply relax at camp and soak in the beauty of your surroundings. Damaraland is typified by magnificent table-topped mountains, rock formations and bizarre-looking vegetation. The present day landscape has been formed by the erosion of wind, water and geological forces that have formed rolling hills, dunes, gravel plains and ancient river terraces.&#xA0; The solitude of the area as well as the scenic splendor gives you an understanding of the wilderness. Activities here include nature walks and nature drives. The expert and experienced guides will give you a new insight into this unique desert environment.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt; Damaraland Camp (B,L,D)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Damaraland&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After an early breakfast, you will be treated to an exciting 4x4 excursion along the ephemeral Huab and Aba Huab River valleys to explore this remarkable region and to search for game, including the elusive desert-adapted elephants if they are in the area.&#xA0; In habitats with sufficient vegetation and water, an adult elephant consumes as much as 300 kg/661lbs of food and 230 liters/61 gallons of water every day of its life. Other large mammals include black rhinoceros and giraffe. Their ranges extend from river catchments in northern Kaokoveld as far south as the northern Namib. Rivers course northwards from the Ugab to provide them with possible routes across the desert, right to the Skeleton Coast. The biggest are the Hoarusib, the Hoanib, the Huab and the Ugab rivers.&#xA0; The elephants in Kaokoland and the Namib walk further for water and fodder than any other elephant in Africa. The distances between waterholes and feeding grounds can be as great as 68 km/42 mi.&#xA0; The typical home range of a family herd is some eight times as big as ranges in central Africa where rainfall is much higher. They walk and feed at night and rest during the day. To meet their nutritional and bulk requirements they browse on no fewer than 74 of the 103 plant species that grow in their range. Not a separate species or even a subspecies, they are an ecotype unique to Namibia in Africa south of the equator. Elephants in Mali on the southwestern fringe of the Sahara Desert are the only others known to survive in similar conditions.&#xA0; Damaraland is home to a variety of desert-adapted wildlife and hidden desert treasures. You will normally take a picnic lunch and stop to take that in the shade of a large Ana tree, or you also have the option to return to camp for lunch, if you prefer.&#xA0; This afternoon, you can opt for a visit to the Twyfelfontein, one of Namibia&#x2019;s key national monuments as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its ancient petroglyphs strewn across boulders and slabs of red sandstone.&#xA0; Some 2,500 prehistoric engravings depict wildlife, animal spoor and abstract motifs, which feature mainly circles. Stone tools and other artifacts found at Twyfelfontein suggest that hunter-gatherers occupied the site over a period of perhaps 7,000 years. This is perhaps the largest and finest collection of petroglyphs in Africa. The engravings show animals such as elephant, giraffe, kudu, lion, rhinoceros, springbok, zebra and ostrich that once used to drink from a fountain at the bottom of the hill.&#xA0; Burnt Mountain is a rounded hill located a few kilometers from Twyfelfontein&#xA0; that appears to catch fire at sunrise and sunset. Its fantastic range of colors at dawn and dusk are due to a chemical reaction that took place roughly 125 million years ago when molten lava penetrated organic shale and limestone deposits, resulting in contact metamorphism. In ordinary sunlight it is a dull black.&#xA0; Blackened rubble lies to one side like cinders from the original fire. The Organ Pipes are another geological curiosity in the area consisting of a mass of perpendicular dolerite columns that intruded the surrounding rocks about 125 million years ago and have since been exposed in a ravine due to river erosion. &lt;strong&gt;Damaraland Camp (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 6: Damaraland / Ongava Game Reserve &amp;amp; Etosha National Park &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today after a very early breakfast, you set off on your journey to the Etosha National Park, traveling via the Grootberg Pass. Along the way, your guide will take you to visit a local Himba settlement. But the HImba people are semi-nomadic, and move locations with no notice. They are one of the last truly traditional peoples of Namibia and, indeed Africa. Here, you will learn about the customs and traditions of this very proud nation.&#xA0; The Himba, Tjimba and other Herero people who inhabit Namibia&#x2019;s remote northwestern Kunene Region are loosely referred to as the Kaokovelders.&#xA0; Basically, Herero in terms of origin, language and culture, they are semi-nomadic pastoralists who tend to move from one watering place to another. For many centuries they have lived a relatively isolated existence. Himba are the largest group of Kaokovelders. They are a tall, slender and statuesque people, characterized especially by their proud yet friendly bearing. The women especially are noted for their unusual sculptural beauty, enhanced by intricate hairstyles and traditional adornments. They rub their bodies with red ochre and fat, a treatment that protects their skins against the harsh desert climate. The homes of the Himba of Kaokoland are simple, cone-shaped structures of saplings, bound together with palm leaves and plastered with mud and dung. The men build the structures, while the women mix the clay and do the plastering. A fire burns in the headman&#x2019;s hut day and night, to keep away insects and provide light and heating. A family may move from one home to another several times a year to seek grazing for their goats and cattle. Men, women and children adorn themselves with necklaces, bracelets, anklets and belts made from iron and shell beads. With their unusual and striking designs, these items have gained a commercial value and are being produced on a small scale for the urban market. Sculptural headrests in particular are sought-after items. En route to your lodge, break for a picnic lunch. You arrive very late in the afternoon or early evening at your lodge in Ongava Game Reserve, a private game reserve along the southwest border of Etosha National Park, much of it made up of saline depressions or &#x2018;pans&#x2019;.&#xA0; The largest of these pans, the Etosha Pan, can be classified as a saline desert in its own right. The Etosha Pan lies in the Owambo Basin, on the northwestern edge of the Namibian Kalahari Desert.&#xA0; Until three million years ago, it formed part of huge, shallow lake until the Kunene River changed course.&#xA0; Today,&#xA0;it fills with water only when sufficient rain falls to the north in Angola. The park consists of grassland, woodland and savannah and has about 114 mammal and more than 340 bird species.&#xA0; The Ongava Game Reserve is also home to those same species &#x2013; elephant, lion, giraffe, blue wildebeest, eland, kudu, gemsbok (oryx), zebra, rhino, cheetah, leopard, hyena, honey badger and warthog, as well as the endemic black faced impala.&#xA0; The scenery is attractive with large open plains blending into Mopane tree woodlands and granite outcrops.&#xA0;&#xA0; Savor some time at leisure, which can be spent appreciating the unique surroundings and enjoying the game viewing at the camp&#x2019;s floodlit waterhole.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ongava Lodge (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 7: Southern Etosha Boundery / Eastern Etosha National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today you scout for wildlife as you drive across the park, stopping at waterholes and for game sightings along the way before exiting through the eastern Von Lindequist Gate to arrive at the luxurious Onguma Plains Camp in the late afternoon.&#xA0; Lunch is served &#x2018;a la picnic&#x2019; en-route and after your arrival at Onguma &#x2013; the Fort, which is positioned to give guests unrivalled views of the spectacular Namibian sunset.&#xA0; Overlooking the beautiful scarceness of the Etosha Pans, your camp offers uncompromised luxury. Each suite has sprawling views of Etosha and Fisher&#x2019;s Pan, and has a spacious bathroom with both an indoor and&#xA0; private outdoor shower. From every corner of your suite, wooden decks and sun-loungers invite you to come out and play. Elaborate antique African doors, raw plastered walls and elegant furnishing fuse classic African style with a touch Moroccan and Indian themes. At Onguma - The Fort, the diverse wildlife can be enjoyed from the comfort of your suite, on a sunset game drive or from the main tower &#x2013; offering unparalleled views of this unique landscape. Zebra, giraffe, lion, a variety of antelope and superb birdlife will accompany you during your stay. After dinner you have the option to go on a night drive for the opportunity to see some of the nocturnal animals found on the reserve.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Onguma - The Fort&#xA0; (B,L,D)&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 8: Etosha National Park &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Set out today for a full day of exciting game viewing in the eastern section of Etosha National Park. You guide also offers you the opportunity to go on to Halali or you can concentrate on the areas closer to Namutoni and north to Fischer&#x2019;s Pan. You also have the option to return to the lodge for lunch, or to stay out for the whole day in the park to maximize your game viewing experience. This afternoon you will be treated to an exciting afternoon drive on the Onguma Game Reserve.&#xA0; The reserve is situated on the eastern side of Etosha and bordering Fisher&#x2019;s Pan, and has more than 30 large animal species, including kudu, giraffe, eland, oryx, hartebeest, zebra, impala and many more roam freely, as well as predators such as lion, cheetah and leopard.&#xA0;&#xA0; After dinner, you can join a night drive on the reserves for another look at the night hunters found on the reserve. The rest of the evening can be spent game viewing at the camps&#x2019; floodlit waterhole. &lt;strong&gt;Onguma &#x2013; The Fort (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 9: Etosha National Park / Okonjima, Africat Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
After a leisurely breakfast, head south via Otjiwarongo.&#xA0; You can stop a few kilometers outside Tsumeb to visit Lake Otjikoto, actually a sink hole.&#xA0; Arrive at Okonjima and the AfriCat Foundation, located at the base of the Omboroko Mountains.&#xA0; This is a wonderful highlight on which to conclude your safari. Here you can enjoy the welcoming atmosphere, superb accommodation and fantastic activities.&#xA0; You can begin with a guided excursion and a visit to the night hide after dinner.&#xA0; Okonjima is home to the AfriCat Foundation, a wildlife sanctuary that focuses on the research and rehabilitation of Africa's big cats, especially injured or captured leopard and cheetah. Close encounters with these majestic big cats are an unforgettable highlight of your safari. Activities include leopard tracking by vehicle, a visit to the cheetah welfare project and to the night hide where nocturnal animals such as porcupine, caracal, honey badger and even leopard may be seen. Overlooking a waterhole, with the sandstone Omoroko Mountains as a backdrop, the Okonjima Bush Suite is nestled in the open acacia thorn veld amidst a secluded wilderness area. The Okonjima Bush Suite consists of two separate, private, en suite bedrooms under a magnificent thatched roof, with a fully equipped kitchen. The living space boasts a spacious lounge, a dining area under-roof or outside under natural shade, and an open wood-burning fireplace. There is also a uniquely designed pool.&#xA0; The bedrooms have high roofs with fans, air-conditioning and when needed, heating facilities.&#xA0; Each room has two queen-size beds, of which one can be wheeled outside onto the terraces for a night under the stars!&#xA0; The doorways have an elegant but practical, &#x2018;scroll-down&#x2019; canvas partitioning that contains heavy-duty gauze screens. On either side, two large glass-paneled windows enhance your 180&#xBA; vista.&#xA0; The zip-fastened, secure, tent-style canvassing not only provides sufficient light, but also contributes to the impression of living in the wild by delivering the audible ambience of your surroundings, while still maintaining a degree of comfort and safety. Each bathroom has both an inside shower and a spectacular, outside bush-shower, together with a beautiful, colonial, bath-with-a-view.&#xA0; Each bedroom has a Wi-Fi or dial-up, internet connection with ample workspace. A personal host/hostess and chef attend to your needs while you enjoy the exclusive guide and game-drive vehicle, thus setting the pace that bests your family.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt; Okonjima Bush Suite (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10:&#xA0; Okonjima - Africat Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, you can choose to participate in a guided activity such as the radio-tracking of the rehabilitated spotted hyenas on the Large Carnivore Tracking Trail, go on one of our self-guided walking trails for some excellent bird watching. Return to the Bush Suite for a sumptuous brunch. Your early afternoon can be spent relaxing by the swimming pool overlooking the waterhole and enjoying the tranquility of the sun until you go out on another AfriCat excursion after &#x2018;coffee and cake&#x2019; in the afternoon.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Okonjima Bush Suite (B,L,D)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;Upon arrival in Santiago, your driver and guide welcomes you and transfers you to your boutique hotel in downtown Santiago. The hotel is a Chilean national monument due to its original, exquisite French architecture.&#xA0; After some time to freshen up, you will embark on a city tour of historic Santiago that begins in the city&#x2019;s Central Market, a colorful cornucopia of fresh food &#x2013; seafood, fruits, vegetables, and flowers, all housed in an exquisite 19th century wrought-iron building, designed by Gustave Eiffel, the famous designer of the Eiffel Tower in Paris.&#xA0; Continue to the main avenues of the civic center and the seat of government, the neoclassical La Moneda Palace, built in the 1700s. The Plaza de Armas, Santiago&#x2019;s beautiful main square, is surrounded by 18th-century architecture &#x2013; Catedral Metropolitana, National Historical Museum, and the Central Post Office.&#xA0; Leaving downtown, you travel towards the Parque Forestal, leading to the Fine Arts Museum and Bellavista, the bohemian artsy center of Santiago.&#xA0; Enjoy lunch at the Bocanariz Restaurant in the Lastarria district. Bocanariz is a wine bar as well as an innovative restaurant, where the cuisine&#xA0;paired with their extensive collection of wines much as this old restored house has been paired with today&#x2019;s technologies to provide the best of both plus excellent service. Served by its owners and a trained team of sommeliers, the ambiance is warm and casual.&#xA0; After lunch, explore the newly re-opened Chilean Museum of Pre-Columbian Art, dedicated to the study and display of pre-Columbian artworks and artifacts from Central and South America. The museum houses the private collection of pre-Columbian artifacts acquired by the Chilean architect and antiquities collector Sergio Larra&#xED;n Garc&#xED;a-Moreno over the course of nearly 50 years. The museum first opened in December 1981 and closed in late 2011 for renovation. After our visit to this fascinating museum, your driver and guide will escort you back to your hotel, where you have the rest of the afternoon at leisure. This evening, you&#xA0;enjoy&#xA0;dinner at one of Santiago&#x2019;s best restaurants, Astrid &amp;amp; Gaston.&#xA0; Owned and operated by Lima-based chef Gast&#xF3;n Acuria and his German wife, the menu features creatively prepared Chilean seafood as the highlight.

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Santiago&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast today, join your guide and driver&#xA0;to discover Bellavista &#xA0;district and La Chascona, which is one of the former houses of Pablo Neruda, Nobel Prize winner in literature.&#xA0; Neruda designed much of La Chascona himself, continually&#xA0;changing the architect&#x2019;s original blueprints to create&#xA0;spaces for specific objects that he had collected. The result is&#xA0;an unconventional and extraordinary house.&#xA0; In addition, his then lover, who later became his third wife, personally&#xA0; selected and planted every&#xA0;plant in the garden. &lt;em&gt;Note: Museum closed on Mondays&lt;/em&gt;. Then you take a short walk through the Bellavista neighborhood to the studio of Ximena Mandiola, one of Chile&#x2019;s most famous artists.&#xA0; Her paintings are characterized by the use of numerical codes, a language of signs and symbols based on the concept of repetition.

Here we will have the opportunity to see&#xA0;her work as well as that of other established Chilean artists.&#xA0; Then you head for lunch at La Mar Restaurant to enjoy some of Chile&#x2019;s traditional dishes such as&#xA0; ceviche and sample a classic South American drink, the pisco sour.&#xA0; After lunch, take a short trip to the handicraft village of Los Dominicos in a beautiful colonial-style building, with handicrafts in pottery, copper, stone, wood, wool and glass.&#xA0; You can watch the crafts people working with the Andean mountains as a backdrop.&#xA0; After this visit, you will return to your hotel, where you will have the rest of the evening at leisure.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Le Reve Boutique Hotel&#xA0;(B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Casablanca Valley / Valpara&#xED;so&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning after breakfast, you and your driver and guide will head west to Casablanca Valley between the coastal mountain range and the Pacific Ocean.&#xA0; Vineyards have growing here since 1875, but only in the 1980s was the true potential of the valley discovered. The soils and the conditions are in many ways similar to the Napa and Sonoma Valleys in California.&#xA0; This valley is in a temperate climate zone with semiarid tendencies, characterized by alternating short, relatively rainy winters with long, continually dry summers.&#xA0; The valley is oriented in such a way that daily ocean breezes cool the grapes on the vine and result in intensely fruity wines.&#xA0; The tallness and massiveness of the coastal range create a unique topography that causes striking daily and seasonal air current changes in the valley thus generating a very special microclimate.&#xA0; Additionally, favorable sunlight conditions influence the grape ripening process, creating unique conditions that provide its wines with special features.&#xA0; Here, we will visit the Kingston Family Vineyards, a boutique winery on the ranch that has been in their family for more than a century. They feature Pinot Noir, Syrah and Sauvignon Blanc in small lots using custom equipment and techniques brought from California.&#xA0; Until the 2009 harvest, they exported virtually all of their wines.&#xA0; Tour the vineyards, watch the process of making artisanal wines, and enjoy a tasting of their Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir and Syrah, while enjoying a gourmet picnic overlooking the sweeping views of the Casablanca Valley. Next, continue to the coast and the port city of Valpara&#xED;so. Upon arrival, enjoy a leisurely walking tour of the city, which begins at Errazuriz Street to see examples of early 20th century, British-influenced architecture.&#xA0; Admire the panoramas from a popular viewpoint at &#x201C;21 de Mayo&#x201D; with its excellent vistas of the colorful hillside houses, the port and across the bay.&#xA0; Take the &#x201C;Artilleria&#x201D; elevator (funicular) and descend to get to the trolley that leads you to &#x201C;Cerro Concepci&#xF3;n&#x201D; and more gorgeous views. You will descend via the &#x201C;Los Perales&#x201D; elevator that leads to Sotomayor square.&#xA0; After this tour, your driver and guide will take you to your hotel in the heart of Cerro Alegre, facing an impressive view of the bay of Valpara&#xED;so.&#xA0; This boutique hotel is in a carefully restored 1920s mansion offers a delightful combination of modern comfort and warm elegant echoes from the past.

From here, you enjoy a 45-minute walk along the beachfront, which faces an island with an active penguin colony.&#xA0; This little resort town is the choice of Chile&#x2019;s elite. Nestled between surrounding hills and the vast ocean, the town has the charm of Santa Barbara in California and Positano in Italy.&#xA0; After the walk, you are ready for lunch at Chiringuito Restaurant, with its spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean.&#xA0; After lunch, return to your hotel in Valpara&#xED;so, where you will have the rest of the afternoon at leisure.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Higueras (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

This revolutionary winery&#xA0;produces&#xA0;Casa Lapostolle&#x2019;s world-class, iconic wine Clos Apalta. The winery is 100% gravity-fed spanning five levels, three of which are buried into the granite of the Apalta hillside to provide a natural cool temperature environment for cellaring and ageing. This rare vertical design allows the wine to flow naturally downward during every stage of the production, eliminating the need to pump, which can adversely affect the subtle flavors of the wine. Tour their organic and biodynamic winemaking facilities, and later enjoy a special lunch in their restaurant, where you will savor each course prepared with the best local ingredients, and paired with one of estate&#x2019;s outstanding wines. Next on the agenda is the Neyen de Apalta Winery, where you will find the perfect blend of tradition and modernity.&#xA0;The Rojas family founded the winery in 2002 on the site of one of the area&#x2019;s pioneering wineries&#xA0;dating back to the late 19th century.&#xA0; The vineyards enjoy a privileged location within the horseshoe-shaped Apalta Valley: a small valley protected by the nearby Coastal Range from the winds that blow through the Tinguiririca River Canyon.&#xA0; See their facilities followed by a special tasting of Neyen&#x2019;s wine and locally produced chocolates.&#xA0; A trained oenologist will show you the best ways to savor artisanal local chocolates that are paired with vertical tasting of Neyen&#x2019;s wine to give you a totally unique taste sensation.&#xA0; Your driver takes you to your hotel.

&lt;/strong&gt;Today, you are transferred on an early morning flight from Yangon to Bagan, on arrival you are met and transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; Bagan is a spectacular plain stretching away from the Ayeyarwaddy River, dotted with thousands of 800-year-old temple ruins. Although human habitation here&#xA0;dates back almost to the beginning of the Christian era, Bagan entered its golden period with the conquest of Thaton in 1057 AD.&#xA0; King Anawrahta started the construction of the Schwezigon Pagoda to enshrine some relicts of Buddha. The construction was finished by his successor between 1086 and1090. Originally, this pagoda marked the northern end of the city of Bagan. The stupa's graceful bell shape became a prototype for virtually all later stupas in Myanmar.&#xA0; Gubyaukhyi Temple at Wetkyi-Inn was constructed early in the 13th Century and repaired in 1468. The great colorful painting of the previous life of Buddha and the distinguished architecture make this temple distinctive.&#xA0; Ananda Pahto is one of the finest, largest, best preserved, and most revered of the Bagan temples. Thought to have been built around 1105, this perfectly proportioned temple heralds the stylistic end of the Early Bagan period and the beginning of the Middle Bagan period.&#xA0; Another Gubyaukgyi Temple, this one at Myinkaba, was built in 1113, and is famous for its well-preserved stuccos from the 12th century on the outside walls. The magnificent paintings date from the original construction of the temple and are considered the oldest original paintings in Bagan.&#xA0; Manuha Temple was built in 1059 by the King of Thaton, and enshrines an unusual combination of three seated and one reclining images of Buddha.&#xA0; Shwesandaw Paya dates from 1057, and is the first monument in Bagan to feature stairways leading up from the square bottom terraces to the round base of the stupa. This pagoda is an ideal spot to catch one of Bagan's magnificent sunsets.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Thiripyitsaya Sanctuary Resort Bagan &#x2013; Deluxe River View Room (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: Bagan&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, you are in for a very special experience &#x2013; a hot air balloon ride over Bagan!&#xA0; Drifting over the plains and temples of this ancient city offers you views that no ancient king or mystic could have imagined. Upon landing, enjoy some refreshments, before continuing on your touring. Mount Popa rises 737 meters/2,418 feet from the flat surrounding Myingyan Plain. It is an extinct volcano last active 250,000 years ago. It is also the site of many temples, and is considered the abode of Myanmar's most powerful nats (spirits) and, as such, is the most important nat worship center in the country.&#xA0;You continue to experience the fascinating lore and history of the area. This afternoon, explore Bagan&#xA0;on a privately guided bicycle tour.&#xA0;&lt;em&gt;A vehicle is close by should you wish to explore part by vehicle&lt;/em&gt;. &#xA0;Bagan is a spectacular plain stretching away from the Ayeyarwaddy River, dotted with thousands of 800-year old temple ruins. Although human habitation at Bagan dates back almost to the beginning of the Christian era, Bagan only entered its golden period with the conquest of Thaton in 1057 AD. You will&#xA0;explore several temples such as&#xA0;Shwegugyi, built&#xA0;in 1311, is&#xA0;an elegant&#xA0;example of the Middle period, a transition in architectural style from the dark and cloistered to the airy and light. Thatbyinnyu Pahto is an 'Omniscient' temple,&#xA0;one of the tallest in Bagan, rising to 61m/200ft and dates from around the mid-12th century.&#xA0;Following the sacking of Thaton, King Anawrahta carted off some 30 elephant-loads of Buddhist scriptures, and built Pitaka Taik as a library to house them in 1058. The design follows the basic Early Bagan Gu plan, perfect for the preservation of light-sensitive, palm-leaf scriptures.

The marble block from the mines of nearby Sagyin was so colossal that it required 10,000 men laboring for 13 days to transport it from a canal to the current site.&#xA0; Sandamani Paya is a cluster of slender whitewashed stupas.&#xA0; The Paya enshrines an iron image of the Buddha cast in 1802, and transported here from Amarapura in 1874.&#xA0; Mahamuni Paya originally built by King Bodawpaya in 1784 when a road paved with bricks was constructed from his palace to the paya's eastern gate. The centerpiece of the shrine is the highly venerated Mahamuni image, which was moved here from Mrauk U in Rakhaing in 1784.&#xA0; Kuthodaw Paya has a central stupa modeled on the Shwezigon Paya near Bagan.&#xA0; Began 1857, the paya has been dubbed 'the world's biggest book.' Standing around the central stupa are 729 marble slabs that have been inscribed with the entire Tripitaka, &#x201C;Three Baskets,&#x201D; used by Buddhist traditions to describe canons of scriptures.&#xA0; Visit Mandalay Hill, an easy climb up the sheltered steps brings one to a panoramic view over the palace, Mandalay and the paya-studded countryside.

Inhabited by the warlike Caribe Indians before colonization by the Spaniards, the colonial city was built between the 14th and 19th centuries. &#xA0;The city came&#xA0;under constant attack by pirates and buccaneers, so the Spanish surrounded the Cartagena with the largest fortifications of any city in the Americas.&#xA0; It&#xA0;was the first province to gain independence on November 11, 1811 as recorded in the Acta de Independencia Absoluta de Espa&#xF1;a. The city remains an &#xA0;architectural treasure of civil, religious, military and governmental buildings. &#xA0;Included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, Cartagena&#x2019;s history is evident in its alleyways and streets. You still find evidence today of pirate assaults, the dreaded Tribunal of the Inquisition and the severe religious rule imposed by the Dominican order that had great power to decide the fate of citizens. &#xA0;The cultural wealth resulting from the mix of races, its history, art, architectural beauty and the sea make Cartagena one of the most fascinating towns in the Caribbean and a wonderful way to end your adventure.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Sofitel Santa Clara Hotel (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Originally established as a cattle ranch during Tanzania's colonial period, Manyara Ranch remains an operating ranch with a relatively small herd of beef cattle and black-headed sheep. In 2000, the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) obtained management and conservation rights to the ranch to protect the vital wildlife corridors. In so doing, they established a working relationship with the local Maasai, developing community conservation projects and rehabilitating the ranch itself.&#xA0; The ranch is held in trust by the Tanzania Land Conservation Trust (TLCT) for the benefit of the local communities and Tanzania.&#xA0; As in Kenya, the conservancy model here is working to&#xA0;preserve the priceless lands and wildlife of the country. The conservancy provides guided game walks, night game drives in 4x4 open safari vehicles&#x2019; game viewing from hides overlooking waterholes and horseback riding with big game.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Manyara Ranch Conservancy (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Your experience here will be like none other, the conservancy provides guided game walks, day and night drives, visits to partner villages in authentic settings and activities including horseback riding with big game, bush breakfast and dinners and participative research activities to promote on-going conservation projects in collaboration with the African Wildlife Foundation. There are several large dams on the ranch that attract and retain the wildlife within the conservancy area. There is a significant resident population of wildlife including groups of large bull elephants, breeding herds of giraffe, many lesser kudu, wildebeest, zebra, gazelle, oryx and eland. There are also predators, including lion, cheetah, leopard, hyena, jackal and bat-eared foxes. For many years, the rare African wild dogs have denned on the ranch. The resident game population is continually being increased by wildlife moving through the migratory corridors. There is a large number of species of birds including many raptors. Manyara Ranch has a variety of habitats that encompass open savannah, acacia woodland, bush and riverine forest, and&#xA0;support a large diversity of wildlife and birdlife.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Manyara Ranch Conservancy (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10:&#xA0;Manyara &#xA0;Ranch Conservancy&#xA0;/ Nairobi, Kenya / Depart&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, you are transferred to Arusha. After lunch, board your flight back to Nairobi, where you are met and escorted to the Ole Sereni hotel. A dayroom has been reserved for your convenience.&#xA0; Then it&#x2019;s a warm welcome from the long-legged beauties at authoress Bette Melville&#x2019;s exclusive Giraffe Centre. Here you&#x2019;ll have a close up chance to photograph the Rothschild giraffe.&#xA0;&#xA0; In the&#xA0;afternoon, visit the Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage run by the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust overlooking Nairobi National Park. The late David Sheldrick stands out, even today, as one of Africa's most famous and proficient Pioneer National Park Wardens of all time. With just one vehicle, and a handful of laborers, he was given the task of transforming a huge chunk of inhospitable arid land, previously&#xA0;known only as the Taru Desert, into what today is one of Kenya's largest and most famous parks,&#xA0;Tsavo National Park. His wife, Daphne Sheldrick, was the first person ever&#xA0;to successfully hand rear newborn fully milk dependent African elephant orphans, which&#xA0;took&#xA0;28 years of trial and error to achieve. By&#xA0;2008, the Trust had successfully saved and hand-reared over 82 infant African elephant calves. When a tiny newborn elephant is orphaned, often because its&#xA0;mother and family have been gunned down to serve the ivory trade, its life support is gone. Any survivors flee in terror. Unless rescued, it is left to&#xA0;die in hopeless and lonely isolation that it cannot understand.&#xA0;&#xA0;Big Five works very closely with the Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage and is emotionally connected to their mission. Therefore, we will&#xA0;foster an orphan in your name,&#xA0;which allows you to visit&#xA0;when the general public is not permitted. Enjoy your time at the Sheldrick Elephant Orphanage where you will be joined by other foster donors.&#xA0;The trust also&#xA0;takes in&#xA0;endangered black rhinos.&#xA0; This evening bid Kwaheri, Swahili goodbye, as you transfer to the airport for your late evening flight.&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Ole Sereni Hotel - Dayroom (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Founded in the year 1524, the town grew up along the&#xA0;shores of Lake Nicaragua.

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Granada&#xD;

At the main plaza, a walking tour explores the surrounding area including La Merced Church, the museum within Casa de los Tres Mundos, the colonial house of the Zamora family, who has lived here for generations, and the San Francisco Convent. The convent, and the church it is attached to, was first erected in 1525. Pirates burned down the convent 1665. Today the convent-cum-museum is noted for its ancient catacombs beneath the convent and church. Priests and other citizens of Granada have been buried here since 1546. An estimated 75,000 people have been buried in the catacombs&#x2019; walls. &#xA0;UNESCO is considering listing&#xA0;Granada as a Heritage of Mankind Site.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Plaza Colon (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Don Carlos Pellas, named by &lt;i&gt;America Economia&lt;/i&gt; as one of the 50 most influential persons in Latin America, is the man behind this luxury property. He succeeded in creating one of the most exclusive boutique resorts in the world &#x2013; a luxurious yet relaxed private estate by the ocean.&#xA0; The hotel and its 37 accommodations are designed in a style that combines modern elegance with the work of Nicaraguan artisans, who crafted fine furnishings from local materials such as sustainable local teak for tables, headboards of woven sugarcane twigs and lamps made of clay from nearby Masaya Volcano. &#xA0;Your room, bohio, is 621 square feet and features high ceilings and a wall of glass that opens onto a sweeping wooden deck with a private plunge pool.

Golfers will love the 18 holes designed by master architect David McLay Kidd that teeter over the edge of ocean bluffs and plunge down to the sandy shore. Each hole has been designed around existing trees and each is irrigated by natural arroyos. Bridges and cart paths are made from local wood and volcanic stone. Be as active or laid back&#xA0;as you choose.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Mukul Beach, Golf &amp;amp; Spa &#x2013; Bohio&#xA0; (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

The Lord of Sipan is the name given to the first of several Moche mummies found at Huaca Rajada, Sipan by archaeologist Walter Alva in 1987. Some archaeologists consider this one of the most important archaeological discoveries in South America because the main tomb was found intact,&#xA0;untouched by looters.&#xA0; By 2007, fourteen tombs had been located and identified. The Royal Tombs of Sipan Museum was constructed in nearby Lambayeque to house most of the artifacts.&#xA0; Of exceptional beauty are the three pairs of turquoise and gold ear ornaments showing ducks, deer, and the Lord of Sipan himself as well as the breastplates of delicately threaded shell beads. The necklace contains gold spheres and&#xA0;huge peanut shells - ten of which were in silver, ten in gold. The scepter is decorated with an inverted gold pyramid with scenes of human sacrifice. There are also objects made of copper, spondyllus shells, fish vestiges, and semiprecious stones.&#xA0; Continue to the Tucume Archaeological Site. Purgatorio (purgatory) is the name by which local people refer to the dozens of pre-Hispanic pyramids, enclosures and mounds found on the plain around La Raya Mountain, south of La Leche River. Tucume covers an area of more than 218 hectares/540 acres and encompasses 26 major pyramids and platforms. This site was a major regional center, maybe even the capital of the successive occupations of the area by Lambayeque/Sican (1000/1100-1350 AD), Chim&#xFA; (1350-1450 AD) and Inca (1450-1532 AD). Your next stop is the Sican Museum in Ferre&#xF1;afe, which displays the daily aspects of the Sican culture, including the different methods for making pottery and metal crafts. The museum also has an interesting display of the tombs of the Sican nobility. &lt;strong&gt;Casa Andina Select (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Chiclayo/ Santa Rosa/ Pimentel / Trujillo&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Early this morning, you travel a short distance to Santa Rosa to see the fishermen in their traditional boats,&#xA0;caballitos,&#xA0;made of totora reeds.&#xA0; Your guide will explain the history behind these boats, which dates back to the ancient pre-Inca era. Then, you will have the chance to board one of the traditional boats and try your hand at fishing or kayaking. After lunch at the resort in Pimentel, you will see how these rugged, little Caballito De Totora are made. Then, join your guide&#xA0;for the four-hour&#xA0;overland transfer to Trujillo. &lt;strong&gt;Libertador Hotel Trujillo&#xA0; (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: Trujillo&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today, with your guide, you will explore the world of&#xA0;Chan Chan, capital of the Chimu Kingdom, which reached its peak in the 15th century.&#xA0; Soon after, however, it fell under the Incas. The planning of this huge city made of mud reflects a strict political and social strategy, marked by its division into nine "citadels" or "palaces," which were independent units.&#xA0; The remarkable city is the largest pre-Columbian city in the Americas and one of the largest in the world.&#xA0; Its importance is comparable to the ancient cities of Egypt, Mesopotamia, India, China and Mexico. The palaces, temples, squares, ponds, gardens, aqueducts and labyrinths occupy an area of 15-square kilometers/5.8-square miles.&#xA0; The walls are decorated with stylized, carved drawings of fish, pelicans, rhombuses, and foxes. Then, visit Huanchaco, the famous surfing resort in&#xA0;Northern Peru. In this area, the caballito de Totora boats are used for surfing. Even prior to the Incas coming here, local fishermen use these reed boats for travel and fishing.&#xA0; After a long day of fishing, the men developed a way of surfing just for recreation. Today, surfing is practiced all along the coast of Peru, and most especially in Huanchaco. You have the option to enjoy some surfing lessons before trying your hand at this ancient sport, whether you are new to surfing or an experienced surfers.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Libertador Hotel Trujillo (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Trujillo / Lima / Juliaca / Puno&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Transfer to the airport to board your flight to Juliaca with a stop in Lima. On arrival at the Juliaca airport, you are met and transferred to the town of Puno on the shores of Lake Titicaca. The rest of the day is at leisure to settle in. Perched at a breathtaking 3,800 meters/12,400 feet above sea level, Puno and the surrounding countryside are the cradle of the Aymara civilization and the legendary birthplace of the founders of the Inca Empire. Puno lies on the shore of Lake Titicaca, the world&#x2019;s highest navigable lake. It is from these waters that the Incans believed that&#xA0; Manco Capac, their cultural founder, emerged. &lt;strong&gt;Casa Andina Private Collection Puno (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6: Puno / Lake Titicaca&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Early this morning, begin your exploration of this famous lake. Your first stop is a visit to one of the remarkable floating reed islands, made from the same reeds used in construction the caballito de Totora boats. The islands are home to the Uros Indians, who still live as their ancestors did a thousand years ago.&#xA0; These floating islands are their home. Taquile is a remote island with a remarkable community where Quechua, the language of the Incas, is kept alive by the islanders. The Taquile&#xF1;os are known for their fine hand-woven textiles and clothing, which are regarded as among the highest-quality handicrafts in Peru. Knitting is exclusively performed by males, who start as early as&#xA0;eight years old, while the women exclusively make yarn and weave. Later, upon arrival at your hotel on Suasi Island, you will see how the boats are made in this region of Peru and enjoy a BBQ lunch.&#xA0; On a small private island, your hotel was also built using local materials such as stone, adobe and totora reed. This island has 43 hectares/106 acres and is home to three South American camelids and one of vizcachas as well as other highland plants and animals. After dinner, enjoy a tour of Lake Titicaca at night.&#xA0; You see the Southern sky with the help of a computerized Bushnell five-inch telescope, learning about the cosmogony that the Andean civilizations have developed over time. The experience culminates with a bonfire by moonlight. &lt;strong&gt;Casa Andina Private Collection Suasi (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7: Lake Titicaca&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, go canoeing on Lake Titicaca.&#xA0; This hour-long tour around the island takes you through groups of totoras, where the diversity of the lake's birds can be appreciated. After lunch, visit Martha's Cultural Cabin, where you learn about the unique ecosystem of the high Andean Plateau and the Lake Titicaca region. You have time at leisure this afternoon. You can savor an optional visit to the Andean Spa with a massage or one of their other treatments that includes creams and oils made from local highland plants. &lt;strong&gt;Casa Andina Private Collection Suasi (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8: Lake Titicaca / Puno / Juliaca / Lima&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After a leisurely morning, transfer overland to Juliaca Airport for your flight to Lima. En route to the airport, visit the Tombs of Sillustani. Sillustani provides some of the best ruins in the region. These consist of circular stone towers called &lt;em&gt;chullpas&lt;/em&gt;, which overlook Lake Umayo. These were probably built under Inca Rule, but archaeological evidence seems to point towards a Pan-Andean architectural trend in which these circular structures were the vogue. During the Spanish times, many were destroyed because these impressive structures were associated with idolatry. In Lima, you are greeted&#xA0;and &#xA0;transferred to your hotel. &lt;strong&gt;Casa Andina Private Collection Miraflores (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9: Lima / Ica / Nazca Lines / Ica&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;You are driven three hours to Ica, where you will board an aircraft for a flight over the renowned and mysterious Nazca Lines.&#xA0; You see shapes emerge, including the Spider, the Monkey and many others. Still, not fully explained, these enormous designs made several centuries ago can only be observed from the air.&#xA0; The origin and significance of the Nazca markings still puzzle archaeologists. Maria Rieche, a German scientist who has devoted her life to the study of these fascinating markings, has a more prosaic theory. She believes they made up a huge calendar employed for agricultural purposes by the people who lived in the area thousands of years ago. Made famous in books, TV and movies, as well as featured in National Geographic, this remains a highlight of Peru. In the afternoon, discover the desert of Paracas, which is said to be the most arid desert in the world. Rain is quite infrequent, and the winds blow from east to west. Still it teems with history and culture, and the landscapes will take your breath away.&#xA0; Travel the desert in 4x4 vehicles, especially designed for this environment.&#xA0; The tour begins near the oasis of La Huacachina. Drive over the sand dunes with stops to&#xA0;try your hand at&#xA0;sand boarding downhill on these amazing dunes sculpted into&#xA0;the Peruvian coast. You are accompanied by experienced drivers who will make your desert adventure an experience of a lifetime. &lt;strong&gt;Las Dunas Hotel (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10: Ica / Lima / Depart&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Enjoy a motor boat excursion to the Ballestas Islands, in Paracas National Reserve, to observe sea lions, boobies, pelicans, penguins, and other marine birds. On the boat trip over to the islands, the famous "Candelabro" can be seen, an enigmatic drawing that many people believe is related to the Nazca Lines. Others think it is a representation of the Southern Cross Constellation, or a stylized drawing of a cactus that was used by high Inca and pre-Inca priests as a hallucinogen. This afternoon, you are transferred to Lima Airport where you will board your flight back home&lt;strong&gt; (B)&lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Santiago, Chile&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Chile!&#xA0;After you&#xA0;exit the airport, your Big Five representative will be waiting to welcome you and privately transferred to your hotel.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Le Reve Boutique Hotel - Double Room&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Santiago / Torres Del Paine National Park, Patagonia&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, fly to Punta Arenas.&#xA0;Upon arrival, &lt;em&gt;explora&lt;/em&gt; staff greets you and transfers you with other guests in a comfortable van to your hotel, &lt;em&gt;explora Patagonia&lt;/em&gt;. The trip takes approximately five hours (2.5 hours from Punta Arenas to Puerto Natales on a 249-kilometer/155-mile paved road and 2.5 hours from Puerto Natales to Torres del Paine National Park along a 149-kilometer/93-mile dirt road). The trip includes a snack break. Patagonia is a vast region in the southernmost tip of South America. Indigenous civilizations, sailors and pioneers have contributed to the region&#x2019;s fame. In the heart of Patagonia, Torres del Paine National Park encompasses 242,002 hectares/598,000 acres. &#xA0;At 51&#xBA;07&#x2019; south latitude and 73&#xBA;10&#x2019; west longitude, the park is surrounded by the impressive Paine Mountain Range (Cordillera del Paine). With unusually shaped granite peaks, glaciers, lakes and waterfalls, plus unique flora and fauna, Torres del Paine Park, UNESCO World Heritage Site, is considered by many to be one of the most beautiful places on the planet.&#xA0;At your lodge,&#xA0;&lt;em&gt;explora&lt;/em&gt; Patagonia, the architectural&#xA0;design creates an aura of simplicity while showcasing the unfathomable beauty of the natural environment. Strategically set on the shore of Lake Peho&#xE9;, the hotel&#xA0;was conceived as an exploration base. It features refined comfort for total relaxation and provides the best gear ideally suited for exploring Patagonia. The nearby Casa de Ba&#xF1;os del Ona features an indoor heated pool, exercise machines, sauna, massage room and open-air Jacuzzis.&#xA0;The interior utilizes traditional lenga and cypress woods, handcrafted slate and copper plus furniture made by local artisans. The guides are fluent in English. Explorations require the use of a parka and/or water-repellent windbreaker, wide pants (longjohns or thermal underwear may be advisable at times), good hiking boots with rubber soles (leather or waterproof fabric), or trekking shoes for easier walks, gloves, caps, sunglasses or ski goggles, lip protector and sun block. The hotel&#x2019;s interior has a pleasant temperature ideal for light and informal clothing. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;explora &lt;/em&gt;Patagonia &#x2013; Cordillera Paine Room (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 3/5: Torres Del Paine National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Each day,&#xA0;choose from five different adventures out of a total of more than 40 explorations on foot, horseback, van or boat; half-day or full day. Adventures for each day are selected according to the weather, guests' desires, the duration and difficulties. Excursions into this magnificent landscape are led by expert bilingual guides with a maximum of ten people per guide and all the necessary equipment. At &lt;em&gt;explora&lt;/em&gt;, rain, wind, a sudden snowstorm, or bright sunshine are simply part of the experience. You will be well prepared to enjoy the adventure in every climate condition. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;explora&lt;/em&gt; Patagonia &#x2013; Cordillera Paine Room (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6: Torres Del Paine National Park / Punta Arenas / Santiago&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;You are transferred back to Punta Arenas today for your flight to Santiago. Upon your arrival, you are transferred to your hotel. &lt;strong&gt;Le Reve Boutique Hotel - Double Room&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7: Santiago / Atacama Desert&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Transfer to the airport for the flight to Calama and the gateway to the Atacama Desert. Upon arrival, you are met by the staff of &lt;em&gt;explora &lt;/em&gt;and transferred to your hotel. Between the Pacific Ocean and the Cordillera de los Andes, Atacama is an immense desert with cordilleras, volcanoes, salt flats and hot springs. It has felt the footsteps of pre-Columbian Andean cultures that live on today in the area&#x2019;s small villages. The Atacama culture made important agricultural developments as well as producing particularly beautiful textiles and metallurgy. Their lands were the commercial crossroads for the peoples of Bolivia, Argentina and the Pacific coast. In Atacama, it is possible to appreciate this history as found in the archeological monuments, cemeteries, churches and villages. The traditions still live in religious festivities, in its crafts and in the local folklore. The Atacama oasis, in the middle of the driest desert in the world, is situated at 2,500 meters/8,200 feet above sea level, making the Atacama not only the driest, but also the highest desert on earth. For this reason, the year-round climate is pleasant and the transparency of the light is unique. The outlandish geography of volcanoes, salt flats and high altitude wetlands, has an unparalleled appeal. The oasis of San Pedro is the only place in this area where human life is possible. Once you leave San Pedro and travel towards the altiplanos and volcanoes, you begin to understand&#xA0;the idea of remoteness. You experience an entirely different world, an untamed place far from civilization. The program at &lt;em&gt;explora&lt;/em&gt;&#xA0;Atacama in the oasis of San Pedro puts visitors in the middle of a fantasy where exploration, the leaving and returning, acquires a shape of its own. Your hotel features 52 luxury rooms; each with Jacuzzi and a comfortable sitting area. All drinks, including alcohol and a&#xA0;selection of wines are included as is the use of the four connected outdoor pools and saunas; access to sala de exploradores (explorers&#x2019; room) equipped with maps and books to better understand the region; use of &lt;em&gt;explora&#x2019;&lt;/em&gt;s horses during excursions (gaiters and helmets provided); and use of mountain bikes (helmets provided). Enjoy daily explorations through Atacama's natural environment, and the sites of pre-Columbian, colonial and contemporary cultures, offered according to program, with bilingual guides. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;xplora&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Atacama&#xA0;- Yali Room (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 8/9: Atacama Desert&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Each day,&#xA0;join a variety of explorations; walking, horseback riding or biking. Explorations in Atacama will give you a glimpse into the geography, history, fauna, geological features, volcanoes and ancient villages. Choose from a menu of eight to ten different options specifically selected for each day, according to the weather, guests' desires, the duration and its difficulties. Programs have been designed to allow for gradual acclimatization to the altitude. Some excursions take place in the vicinity of San Pedro, between 2,500 and 3,000 meters/8,200 and 9,850 feet above sea level; while others are at intermediate levels between 3,000 and 4,500 meters/9,840 and 13,120 feet; and the most demanding reach heights of up to 6,000 meters/19,680 feet. Conquer high altitude peaks or simply go for a walk, ride a horse or relax at the hotel &#x2013; your choice. The weather in the Atacama is pleasant throughout the year.&#xA0;Activities are adapted to all ages and levels of abilities to insure everyone gets to know the nature or the history of Atacama. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;explora&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0; Atacama - Yali Room&#xA0;(B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ay 10: Atacama Desert / Tambo Canapa, Bolivia&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Early this morning,&#xA0;set out in your van on a journey through the Licancabur Volcano mountains and cross into Bolivia to begin your discovery of one of the most pristine and awe-inspiring places on earth &#x2013; the Bolivian Altiplano. Along the way, you will stay in remote &lt;em&gt;explora&lt;/em&gt; camps for a genuine experience of this wild place. Visit Sol de Ma&#xF1;ana, a geothermal field at 4,700 meters/15,420 feet. Explore a series of salt pans, wetlands and lagoons, one of which is the Colorada Lagoon, a perfect place to watch flamingos. After lunch, travel to Ca&#xF1;apa, and your first camp shelter - Tambo Ca&#xF1;apa Camp, at 4,300 meters/14,107 feet.&#xA0; It encompasses five containers that have been redesigned with basic but comfortable facilities. During this journey you stay in two types of shelters: isolated containers that have been redesigned, and old shepherd cabins that have been restored.&#xA0;Each shelter includes a sleeping area, a bathroom with cold and hot water and a living area with a kitchen. Each room includes four small beds and sleeping-bags adapted to the local weather conditions, and private&#xA0;bathroom. In these surroundings you begin to understand the immense and solitary nature of the Bolivian Altiplano. &lt;strong&gt;Tambo Canapa Camp Site (B,L,D&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11: Ca&#xF1;apa / Chituca&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, you have the opportunity to investigate the unique geography, flora and fauna found here. At this high altitude, between 4,300 meters/14,107 feet and 3,600 meters/11,811 feet, you walk through former mines, dramatic valleys and boundless plains until you reach the Turquiri Lagoon with its diversity of high plains birds. After lunch,&#xA0;set out towards your second camp site at Chituca, 3,750 meters/12,303 feet.&#xA0;Chituca is a former shepherd settlement of small stone cabins. The setting is simple and enchanting. After a good dinner,&#xA0;relax by the fire and take in the silence of the Altiplano. &#xA0;Salar de Uyuni.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Chituca Camp Site (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 12: Chituca / Tagua / Salar de Uyuni&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast,&#xA0;enjoy activities such as a visit to the cactus forest and the old terrace farms; or visit the village of San Pedro de Quemes, a former Spanish settlement with panoramic views of the plateau and the Salar.&#xA0;Travel on to Las Dos Estrellas, also called the &lt;em&gt;cave of the galaxies&lt;/em&gt;, filled with surprising geological formations. Learn about the mythology and hear stories about the cultures of the region.&#xA0; You will come to a massive plain of salt &#x2013; Salar de Uyuni. At an elevation of 3,665 meters/12,024 feet, it is the largest and highest salt pan on earth. You encounter a tiny fraction of this landscape as you walk the endless white flats and some of its islands. After lunch, travel on to Tagua, a small village on the edge of the Salar, near the Tunupa Volcano.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Tunupa Camp Site (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 13: Tunupa Volcano&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
The Tunupa Volcano is clothed in shades of red, orange and yellow from volcanic minerals in the soil. At 5,432 meters/17,821 feet, it is not easy to hike up this mountain. You must be in good physical condition to attempt this hike.&#xA0; That said, for mountain climbers, this experience is worth it.&#xA0; An easier hike walks around the volcano flanks. As you travel through small villages, wetlands and archeological sites, the Salar will always be present, changing colors throughout the day. &lt;strong&gt;Tunupa Camp Site (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 14: Tunupa Volcano / Aravilla&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Leave early this morning for the Chilean border, walking through the village of Llica, where you stop briefly to sample their famous salte&#xF1;as, typical Bolivian empanadas. Later, you come to another large pan, the Salar de Coipasa at 3,600 meters/11,811 feet before heading to Cochane at the border with Chile. Crossing usually takes time as the administrative procedure is quite long.&#xA0; In the evening, you reach Aravilla, a small village on the Chilean side of the border that was abandoned a few decades ago and where your last shelter is. Depending on your arrival time, you may investigate the wetland next to the shelter, which many believe is the most beautiful of the Altiplano. &lt;strong&gt;Aravilla Camp Site (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 15: Aravilla/ Iquique&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;In the morning, walk to the small village of Mauque. There, enjoy a light lunch before descending to Iquique. This amazing route will take you through mountain chains of complex color ranges. At the end of the route, you come across Humberstone, a giant, old saltpeter works from the 1920s. You can hear the wind brush through the old buildings. You reach Iquique in the late afternoon, ready to enjoy a farewell dinner.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Iquique - Deluxe Room&#xA0;(B,L,D&lt;/strong&gt;)&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 16: Iquique / Santiago / Depart&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today, you are transferred to the airport to catch your departing flight. If you have a later flight, can take some time to look around the city or&#xA0;enjoy its beaches before boarding your flight to Santiago and home. &lt;strong&gt;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0; Arrive Lima, Peru&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Arrival in Lima, the "City of Kings," famous for its Spanish Colonial architecture, extraordinary museums and cuisine. Lima is internationally recognized as the "Gastronomic Capital of the Americas," and its cuisine is considered among the most diverse and exquisite to be found anywhere. Upon arrival, you are welcomed and transferred to the hotel. &lt;strong&gt;Belmond Miraflores Park Hotel&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Lima / Pachacamac / Lima&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Drive along the Pan-American Highway with its views across the beautiful Pacific beaches to visit the pre-Inca ruins of Pachacamac, the most important archaeological site near Lima. Four centuries before the Incas, the Ishmay culture developed a major ceremonial center, featuring streets, dozens of temples fitted with ramps, and the Painted Temple.&#xA0; Next on the menu is a delightful demonstration of the skills of the amazing Peruvian Paso horse, a unique member of the horse kingdom. &#x201C;Caballo de Paso&#x201D; known worldwide for their smooth gaited movements and unusual spirit. No other horse combines strength, intelligence and beauty so perfectly as the Peruvian Paso Horse. The particular characteristic of the Paso Horse is precisely the reason for its name: the sublime charm of its typical step. As it walks, its front legs step very high and forward while the hooves sway to the sides in a graceful and synchronized movement. This afternoon, you explore Lima, both its modern and colonial facets, including La Nacion Museum, the colonial Plaza Mayor, Government Palace, San Francisco Church and the exquisite Torre Tagle Palace, home to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Travel along the Peruvian coast to Ica for a spectacular flight over the landscape of vast drawings &#x2013;figures represented include a spider, a hummingbird and monkey. The Nazca Lines, discovered in 1927, are the most extraordinary legacy left by a culture that flourished in 300 BC. The lines are a series of complex designs, some up to 300 m/984 ft long, which can only be seen in their true dimension from an altitude of at least 457 m/1,500 ft. The Nazca culture is not believed to have been capable of manned flight. But many mysteries remain about just how this ancient culture carried out this feat, how they crafted the drawings, what technology they used, and what&#xA0; purpose they served. Continue to your hotel in Paracas in one of the most arid deserts in the world.&#xA0; Rain is quite infrequent and the winds blow from east to west.&#xA0; The sand dunes create an incomparable image at evening or dawn. This region teems with history and culture. The landscape will take your breath away.

This beautiful city, a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site, features baroque churches and mansions from the colonial period such as like the Monastery of Santa Catalina. The main square is bordered by arched walkways and the 17th century cathedral, which showcases a beautiful bronze fountain of three plates crowned by the figure of a 16th century soldier. Around the square, you see three granite portals with brick and lime bases. Enjoy lunch at local restaurant.&#xA0; The Santa Catalina Convent is a city within a city. A Spanish city in miniature with stone streets, beautiful patios, and plaza, it is a masterpiece of colonial architecture. It houses some of the finest examples of Spanish American religious art. Since 1970, visitors have been able to stroll through the streets and cloisters that during colonial times were the refuge of female nobility, who chose to isolate themselves and dedicate their lives entirely to prayer.&#xA0; This afternoon, you continue to discover the beautiful landscapes of Arequipa and its surrounding districts, including Yanahuara, known as the "balcony of Arequipa"; Caima with its colonial church; and Sabandia with its typical 18th century water mill.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Andina Private Collection Arequipa (B,L)&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Mukul and Guacalito de la Isla are the vision of prominent Nicaraguan entrepreneur Don Carlos Pellas, whose family roots date back to the 19th century. &#xA0;Mukul was designed as a luxurious yet unpretentious and relaxed private estate by the ocean, with 37 accommodations designed in a style that combines modern elegance with traditional Nicaraguan roots to create a distinct sense of place. Interior designer Paul Duesing worked with Nicaraguan artisans to craft furnishings and decorations that reflect the traditions of the country, including tables made of carved native teak, headboards made of woven sugarcane twigs and rum barrel staves, accent pieces made of sand-cast, polished pewter and lamps made of clay from nearby Masaya Volcano. Like tree houses in the lush canopy, Mukul has 23 bohios that perch dramatically on a steep hillside 300 feet above Playa Manzanillo, offering breathtaking ocean views of the horizon. Built of sustainable native teak and pine, these 57.7-square-meter/621-square-foot cliff houses feature high ceilings and a wall of glass that opens onto a sweeping wooden deck with a private plunge pool. The spacious bathrooms are finished in Nicaraguan travertine marble and boast couples&#x2019; &#x201C;showers-with-a-view.&#x201D;&#xA0; Gourmet snacks are offered during the day around the pool and on the beach. Whether in your private villa or bohio, or in the Mukul Beach Club or Mukul Spa, you enjoy complimentary beverages including soft drinks, domestic beers such as To&#xF1;a, a selection of fine wines, premium tequilas, vodka and whiskey. &lt;strong&gt;Mukul Luxury Resort &amp;amp; Spa (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 12/13: Rivas&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Set your own pace at this luxury resort and spa. Be as active or relaxed as you choose. Explore the five kilometers/three miles of hiking and biking trails that run through this lush coastal forest. Search for indigenous wildlife that includes four species of monkey, or find private spot on the miles of white sand beaches.&#xA0; Enjoy world-class fishing year-round. Savor a massage at the Spa Mukul, with six private spa-treatment casitas. Relax at the pool, or get in a round of golf at the 18-hole Guacalito Golf Course, designed by David McLay Kidd, named the &#x201C;hottest architect in golf&#x201D; by &lt;em&gt;Golf World&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Mukul Luxury Resort &amp;amp; Spa (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Hanoi, Vietnam&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Indochina! On arrival you are met and transferred to your hotel. As the modern-day capital of Vietnam, Hanoi blends old-world mystery and charm with the frenetic pace of modern life. Narrow lanes and traditional shop houses invite exploration by cyclo, while its many beautiful public spaces - lakes, parks, tree-lined boulevards and monuments - give the city an air of elegance and harmony with nature unique among Asian capitals. And everywhere there are motorcycles, some of which carry entire families or impossibly overflowing bundles of goods. &lt;strong&gt;Sofitel Legend Metropole &#x2013; Premium Room Opera Wing&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Hanoi&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Tree-lined boulevards and colonial buildings give the city a touch of Western elegance, while crowded blocks of tiny old houses and narrow lanes brim with the colorful activities of daily life. Take a ride in an electric car to visit the Old Quarter, famous for the &lt;em&gt;36 streets of the craftsmen&lt;/em&gt;. Its well-known landmarks include Hoan Kiem Lake, Quan Su Pagoda, Silk Road, Hanoi Railway Station, Hoa Lo Prison and Hanoi Opera House. A brief guided walk through the old section of the city brings the history to life, where you see many Vietnamese still carrying on daily life as generations before them did &#x2013; from shop keepers to restaurant owners. You visit a Communal House, which dates back to the&#xA0;13th century. Communal houses, often called temples, are found across Vietnam in both the country and the cities. A typical Vietnamese communal house resembles a pagoda and can be as richly decorated. Its function is to provide a space for local people to meet and for ceremonies to be held. End the day at the Water Puppet Show. The culturally famous water puppetry is Vietnam&#x2019;s singular variation on the ancient Asian puppet tradition. Literally, the &#x201C;puppets that dance on water&#x201D; is an ancient tradition with origins from as far as the 11th century CE in the villages of the Red River Delta area of Northern Vietnam. As a Big Five guest you will have special access to interact with the puppeteers. Tonight&#x2019;s dinner is very special. The Nineteen 11 is the only restaurant located within the grounds of the famous Opera House. &lt;strong&gt;Sofitel Legend Metropole &#x2013; Premium Room Opera Wing (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Hanoi&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Start your day in a traditional fashion &#x2013; with a private Tai Chi class at Hoan Kiem Lake. Then, enjoy a look at everyday life in Hanoi as you meet up with noted chef and author Daniel Hoyer, who will be your guide for this special tour of the street vender&#x2019;s foods and the markets. Drive to the Cho Hom Market to learn about and taste some of the ingredients used in local cuisine and watch the buying and selling rituals of a Vietnamese market. Daniel will introduce you to some of the vendors, explain about the ingredients for sale. Enjoy a Vietnamese coffee or tea at Daniel's favorite, Cafe Tho, one of the many sidewalk cafes in the historic French Quarter. He will give an overview of the Vietnamese food scene, particularly in Hanoi, and discuss the upcoming activities. Drive to Truc Bach Lake (Ngu Xa Street) for a snack of Pho Cuon, a grilled beef and rice noodle roll. Then make a short visit to a smaller neighborhood market and street vendor area to gain a deeper understanding of cultural and food traditions of Vietnam. Have lunch with Daniel at one of Hanoi's best Bun Cha establishments. Bun Cha Chanh, open only a few hours in the afternoon, is a restaurant run by sisters and uses real wood for cooking where they still fan the fire by hand instead of the ubiquitous electric fans. Situated down a narrow lane, you sit on tiny stools at low plastic tables along with the regular crowd of Bun Cha aficionados and enjoy traditional grilled pork and rice vermicelli noodles with fresh herbs and greens like true Hanoians. Return to your hotel for an afternoon break. Later, you meet with noted art director Suzanne Lecht for a tour of the other side of Hanoi that garners attention &#x2013; the modern art scene. Explore the galleries in Hanoi, and their histories. View current exhibitions. Lecht specializes in the development of the fine arts in Vietnam. The tour culminates with a visit to the 54 Traditions Gallery, the only gallery in Vietnam focusing on the antiques, artefacts and art of Vietnam's 53 minority groups and the Kinh majority. With more than 1,000 objects on display, the collection focuses on the everyday things they use. The antiques and art are set up in rooms that are dedicated to each of the following categories: Central Highlands, Tribal Textiles, The Shamanic Tradition, Functional Objects and Water Puppets.&#xA0; The museum gallery also offers select objects from the Viets (the Kinh), the majority culture of Vietnam, including objects from the distant past. Return to your hotel later today. &lt;strong&gt;Sofitel Legend Metropole &#x2013; Premium Room Opera Wing (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: Hanoi / Halong Bay&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Set out today on a drive to Halong Bay, a UNESCO World Heritage Site with absolutely stunning scenery. The bay features thousands of limestone karsts and isles, with many that jut skyward, many with domes covered in dense rainforest. Here, you board your vessel for a two-night excursion. The evolution of the karst here has taken 20 million years. The first day of your cruise introduces you to the dramatic landscapes of Halong Bay and Bai Tu Long Bay. After cruising to the east of Halong Bay, you travel by row boat to the floating village of Vung Vieng. Cruse into Bai Tu Long Bay, which, when combined with Halong Bay, creates one of the most beautiful bays in the world. &lt;strong&gt;M/V Au Co &#x2013; Deluxe Cabin (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Halong Bay&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Begin your day on the sundeck with Tai Chi. Try this ancient form of movement that is used for relaxation, balance and health while soaking in the amazing panoramic views. After breakfast on board, go on a guided kayaking excursion, and maybe go for a swim in the Vung Ha area, a remote part of the Gulf Of Tonkin, featuring isolated beaches and nature at its most serene. Savor a delicious lunch while the ship cruises towards Lan Ha Bay and Cat Ba Island. Cat Ba Island is the largest in the Gulf of Tonkin, covered with a rainforest ecosystem that supports numerous indigenous species of flora and fauna.

You can visit an organic farm beig developed in the village&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M/V Au Co &#x2013; Deluxe Cabin (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6: Halong Bay / Hanoi / Danang / Hoi An&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After a final morning of cruising, disembark at the pier where you are met and transferred back to Hanoi for your flight to Danang.

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7: Hoi An&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Hoi An is a charming riverside town south of Danang. Known as Faifo to early western traders, it was one of Southeast Asia's major international ports during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. This beautifully preserved city is best seen on foot. Cross the Japanese Covered Bridge Pagoda. The first bridge on this site was constructed in 1593 by the Japanese community of Hoi An to link the town with the Chinese quarters across the stream. The bridge was constructed with a roof so it could be used as a shelter from the rain and sun. Sa Huynh Museum is near the bridge and contains exhibitions from the earliest period of Hoi An's history. Visit the Tran Family Chapel, a house for worshipping ancestors built about 200 years ago. The family traces its origins to China before moving to Vietnam around 1700. The architecture of the building reflects the influence of Chinese and Japanese styles. Phuoc Kien Assembly Hall is a Chinese pagoda dedicated to Thien Hau Thanh Mau, Goddess of the Sea and Protector of Sailors and Fishermen. It was built around 1690, and was restored and enlarged in 1900. This is typical of the Chinese clans in the Hoi An area. Stroll through the historic town to the Thu Bon River, where a boat takes you across the river to the art studio of Sinh Trong. Here you will learn about traditional Vietnamese painting, and hear the story of the artist, who grew up in an orphanage in Hoi An. He has become a successful artist through his own determination and the assistance of Lifestart Foundation, which you will also visit later. Return to town by boat, and visit another workshop to learn how to make your own miniature Hoi An lantern. &lt;strong&gt;The Nam Hai &#x2013; One Bedroom &#x2013; Beachfront Villa (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Chat with the local vendors and experiencing the sights, smells, and action in this vibrant market. Weather permitting, you enjoy a brief 20-minute boat trip up the Thu Bon River to reach the Red Bridge Restaurant and Cooking School, where you prepare five traditional dishes to enjoy with lunch. You also see a demonstration of fruit and vegetable carving.&lt;strong&gt;The Nam Hai &#x2013; One Bedroom &#x2013; Beachfront Villa (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

This afternoon, drive to the impressive studio of a celebrated artist in Saigon&#x2019;s suburban District 2. Being inspired by the lights, shadows and colors of Vietnam, artist Helene Kling has lived and painted in Vietnam since 1996. Wander around her studio to see her stunning artworks and antiques. Learn about her work and her inspiration on each piece. She also supports Operation Smile, by painting to raise funds for children needing cleft surgery. Time permitting, you will have time to relax before setting out this evening to enjoy Saigon like a local. Start with a sundowner drink at the new Skybar which offers panoramic views of the city, followed by a walk along the 23/9 Park. You see the brand new &lt;em&gt;AO &lt;/em&gt;show, an intricate mixture of dance, percussion, acrobats and comedy &#x2013; with bamboo poles and baskets as the only props. From here, you ride to dinner in vintage Vespa scooters to the 3T Quan Nuong Rooftop, a popular BBQ Restaurant. End up next door at Fanny's for ice cream. &lt;strong&gt;Movenpich Hotel Saigon (B,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;strong&gt;Day 16: &#xA0;Luang Prabang / Siem Reap, Cambodia&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Transfer to the airport for your flight to Siem Reap, Cambodia, where you are met on arrival and transferred to your hotel. &#xA0;This afternoon, you begin your exploration of one of the most extraordinary collections of city and temple ruins in Southeast Asia. &#xA0;Angkor Thom was a fortified city that covers an area of 10 square kilometers/3.9 square miles. &#xA0;Enclosed by a wall and wide moats, the city includes many of Angkor's most renowned sites. Enter by the monumental South Gate over a causeway lined on both sides by statues of demons and gods, each carrying a giant naga. Continue to the Terrace of the Elephants and the Terrace of the Leper Kings, former spaces for public ceremonies, both adorned with dramatic bas reliefs. &#xA0;Visit the ruined Baphuon, Royal Enclosure and Phimeanakas before continuing to the mysterious Bayon Temple. &#xA0;In this temple, one of the most popular and compelling in Angkor, explore the galleries of beautifully preserved bas reliefs and ascend narrow stairs that reach the central sanctuary, where you will find giant stone faces smiling enigmatically down at you from every angle. &#xA0;Watch the sun set over the Cambodian countryside from the upper terraces of an ancient Angkorian temple. &lt;strong&gt;Belmond La Residence d&#x2019;Angkor &#x2013; Deluxe Room&lt;strong&gt; (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 17: &#xA0;Siem Reap&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
The crowning jewel of Khmer architecture, Angkor Wat, is the national symbol and the highlight of any visit to Cambodia. &#xA0;The largest, best preserved, and most religiously significant of the Angkor temples, Angkor impresses visitors both by its sheer scale and beautifully proportioned layout, as well as the delicate artistry of its carvings.&#xA0; As you enter the main building, ascend through a series of galleries and courtyard before reaching the central sanctuary, which offers beautiful views back over the causeway and across the surrounding countryside.&#xA0; On the way, you see intricate stone carvings adorning nearly every surface, with some 1,700 Apsaras, celestial dancers, sculpted into the walls. &#xA0;The outer gallery walls displays the longest continuous bas-relief in the world, which narrates stories from Hindu mythology, including the famous Churning of the Ocean of Milk.&#xA0; Angkor Wat is stunning at any time of the day, but sunrise and sunset are especially beautiful times to watch the play of light on the stones. &#xA0;Ta Prohm is one of the most popular attractions of Angkor as much of the jungle has not been cleared away, and it looks very much as it would have appeared to the first European explorers who stumbled across this magnificent site. Seemingly miniature in comparison to the other Angkor temples, Banteay Srei is considered the jewel of classical Khmer art. &#xA0;Built in pink sandstone, the walls are covered in exquisitely preserved carvings of unusual delicacy.&#xA0; Because of its small size, fairy-like atmosphere and extraordinary examples of Khmer sculpture, this temple is a favorite with visitors. &lt;strong&gt;Belmond La Residence d&#x2019;Angkor &#x2013; Deluxe Room&lt;strong&gt; (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 18:&#xA0; Siem Reap &#x2013; Koh Ker&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you have a full day excursion to Koh Ker* and Beng Mealea.&#xA0; Koh Ker was once capital of Jayavarman IV.&#xA0;&#xA0;It features the pyramidal Prasat Thom.&#xA0; Beng Mealea, a 12th-century temple the size of Angkor, lies about 40 kilometers/25 miles from the Bayon.&#xA0; It is enclosed by abroad moat.&#xA0; The temple is still being reclaimed from the jungle as years of conflict in the region left it neglected and almost forgotten.&#xA0; It is now one of the most popular remote temples owing to its wealth of classical bas reliefs.&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belmond La Residence d&#x2019;Angkor &#x2013; Deluxe Room&lt;strong&gt; (B) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;*The Spirit of Big Five Foundation supports the nonprofit Heritage Watch organization in preserving and protecting these important ruins from looting and vandalism while helping the local community realize benefits through sustainable tourism.&lt;/em&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 19: &#xA0;Siem Reap / Bangkok / Depart&#xD;

&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: &#xA0;Nairobi&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Nairobi National Park is managed by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), who, along with the Kitengela Landowners Association (KLA), distribute some of the park&#x2019;s revenues for community projects in the area. There are many issues with wildlife predation on domestic livestock, and the KLA and KWS have an enormous task of managing human-wildlife conflicts.

These enormous herds are closely followed by large predators &#x2013; lion, leopard, hyena and cheetah, easily visible in this rolling landscape. The Masai Mara Reserve is inextricably linked with 80,000 acres of the select and private Mara North Conservancy, where your camp is located.

The walk will be tailored to your family&#x2019;s abilities and interests such as walking in the bush or to a local village.&#xA0; Walking adds an entire different dimension to the safari experience. Senses that may have been a little dulled in a car will strain to perceive indications of the wild game that surrounds you. Walking with Masai Warriors, you experience the bush in much the same way that our pre-historic ancestors did. There is also an opportunity to fly camp.&#xA0; At night, you camp under the stars enjoying meals with the voice of the land around you. &lt;strong&gt;Serian Camp &#x2013; Family Tent (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Here, you walk among elephants in the wilderness of Tsavo East National Park.&#xA0; In the late afternoon you will meet the young elephants going back to their shelters. It&#x2019;s no unusual to encounter wild elephants coming for a drink and the nearby waterhole.

The lodge consists of glass and stone curves, where walls and windows fold away completely to open out to the grassy plains, distant dunes, and mountain ranges. Each spacious, air-conditioned suite features a shaded deck, split level bedroom and living room with fireplace for cool evenings, en-suite glass encased bathroom and outdoor shower. Star gazing is a highlight with a star-viewing sky light in each room and an observatory with a powerful telescope. Guided activities on offer to explore the local reserve include scenic 4x4 nature drives, fascinating walks and exhilarating quad-biking excursions. &lt;strong&gt;Sossusvlei Desert Lodge (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Sossusvlei - Namib Naukluft National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Early this morning you venture into the Namib Naukluft National Park, entering the park at sunrise to experience the dunes while the light is soft and shadows accentuate their towering shapes and curves. Your guide offers insights on the formation of the Namib Desert and its myriad of fascinating creatures and plants that have adapted to survive these harsh environs. This most frequently visited section of the massive Namib Naukluft National Park is Sosssusvlei, famous for its towering apricot colored sand dunes which can be reached by following the Tsauchab River valley. Sossusvlei itself is actually a clay pan set amidst the star shaped dunes which stand up to 300m/984ft above the surrounding plains, ranking them among the tallest dunes on earth. The deathly white clay pan contrasts against the orange sands and forms the endpoint of the ephemeral Tsauchab River, within the interior of the Great Sand Sea. The river course rises south of the Naukluft Mountains in the Great Escarpment. It penetrates the sand sea for some 55km/31mi before it finally peters out at Sossusvlei, about the same distance from the Atlantic Ocean. Until the encroaching dunes blocked its course around 60,000 years ago, the Tsauchab River once reached the sea. Sand-locked pans to the west show where the river flowed before dunes shifted. About once a decade rainfall over the catchment area is sufficient to bring the river down in flood and fill the pan. On such occasions, images of dunes and camel thorn trees around the pan are mirrored in the water.&#xA0; Once you have explored the dune fields, enjoy a relaxing picnic breakfast in the shade of a camel thorn tree. Return to Sossusvlei Desert Lodge in the early afternoon for a late lunch, stopping off to view Sesriem Canyon along the way. The rest of the afternoon is at your leisure or you may like to enjoy another guided excursion on the lodge reserve.. Sossusvlei is the biggest of four pans in the vicinity. Another, famous for its gnarled and ghostly camel thorn trees, is Deadvlei which can be reached on foot over 1km of sand. Deadvlei&#x2019;s striking camel thorn trees; dead for want of water, still stand erect as they once grew. They survived until about 900 years ago when the sand sea finally blocked the river from occasionally flooding the pan. &lt;strong&gt;Sossusvlei Desert Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: Sossusvlei / Damaraland&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After a leisurely breakfast, return to the airstrip to get your scheduled light aircraft flight to Damaraland. The flight route begins with an amazing bird&#x2019;s eye view of Sossusvlei and the great dune sea that stretches to the coast. You then fly north along the coastline (fog permitting) over abandoned mining camps, shipwrecks, Sandwich Harbour, salt pans and Walvis Bay Lagoon before landing at Swakopmund Airport to refuel. Then continue north and inland into the heart of Damaraland, where you will spend two nights at Damaraland Camp. On arrival, you are welcomed by your private naturalist guide, who accompany you for the remainder of your journey. This afternoon you can choose to enjoy a guided walk in the local area or simply relax at camp and soak in the beauty of your surroundings. The area offers displays of color, magnificent flat-topped mountains, interesting rock formations and bizarre-looking vegetation. The present day landscape has been formed over millennia by erosion caused by wind, water and geological forces. The result is rolling hills, sand dunes, gravel plains and ancient river terraces. &#xA0;Your camp is situated in this rugged beauty on the northern banks of the Huab River. This private paradise is wrapped in stunning silence, beauty and tranquility. There are just nine large canvas tents, each with en suite bathroom. The dining room, bar and curio shop are under canvas while an open fire is found nearby. Enjoy nature walks and drives with expert and experienced guides, who give you insights into this unique desert environment, and learn about indigenous communities who have made this their home. &lt;strong&gt;Damaraland Camp (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Damaraland&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After an early breakfast, you will be treated to an exciting 4x4 excursion along the ephemeral Huab and Aba Huab River valleys to explore this remarkable region and to search for game, including the elusive desert-adapted elephants if they are in the area. In habitats with sufficient vegetation and water an adult elephant consumes as much as 300kg/661lbs of roughage and 230 liters/61 gallons of water daily. Their ranges extend from river catchments in northern Kaokoveld as far south as the northern Namib. Apart from the Kunene River, seven river courses northwards from the Ugab provide them with possible routes across the desert, right to the Skeleton Coast. The biggest rivers are the Hoarusib, the Hoanib, the Huab and the Ugab. &#xA0;The elephants in Kaokoland and the Namib walk further for water and food than any other elephant in the world, with the typical home range of a family herd greater than being larger than 2,000km&#xB2;/770&#xB2;mi, or eight times as big as ranges in central Africa where rainfall is much higher. They walk and feed at night and rest during the day. To meet their nutritional and bulk requirements they browse on no fewer than 74 of the 103 plant species that grow in their range. Not a separate species or subspecies, they are an ecotype unique to Namibia, and behaviorally adapted to hyper-arid conditions. Elephant in Mali on the southwestern fringe of the Sahara Desert are the only others known to survive in similar conditions. Damaraland is home to a variety of other specially adapted wildlife, including black rhinos and giraffe. Enjoy a picnic lunch in the shade of a large Ana tree, or you also have the option to return to camp for lunch if you prefer. This afternoon, you can choose to go to see the ancient Twyfelfontein rock engravings (note that this will make for a very long day). Alternatively, can take a walk in the area with your guide or simply relax and enjoy some well-deserved leisure time.&#xA0; Twyfelfontein, &#x2018;doubtful spring,&#x2019; was named by the first European farmer in the area. Strewn over a hillside amongst the flat-topped mountains of red sandstone, Twyfelfontein&#x2019;s boulders and slabs of red sandstone hold some 2,500 prehistoric engravings that depict wildlife, animal spoor and abstract motifs. It is perhaps the largest and finest collection of petroglyphs in Africa. &#xA0;The engravings show animals such as elephant, giraffe, kudu, lion, rhinoceros, springbok, zebra and ostrich that once used to drink from a fountain at the bottom of the hill. In some cases, footprints were engraved instead of hooves or paws. The abstract motifs feature mainly circles. Stone tools and other artifacts found here suggest that hunter-gatherers occupied the site over a period of perhaps 7,000 years. The engravings lie along two circular routes, one an hour&#x2019;s climb and the other 40 minutes longer. Twyfelfontein is one of Namibia&#x2019;s key national monuments as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The &lt;em&gt;Organ Pipes&lt;/em&gt; are another geological curiosity in the area consisting of a mass of perpendicular dolerite columns that intruded the surrounding rocks about 125 million years ago, and have since been exposed in a ravine due to river erosion. A rounded hill just a short distance away is known as Burnt Mountain. In mid-day light, the mountain is a dull black, but come sunrise and sunset, it comes alive with color. The range of colors is due to a chemical reaction that took place roughly 125 million years ago when molten lava penetrated organic shale and limestone deposits, resulting in contact metamorphism. In mid-day light, the mountain is a dull black. Blackened rubble lies to one side like cinders from the original fire. &lt;strong&gt;Damaraland Camp (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6: Damaraland&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, you and your guide visit a local Himba settlement. The semi-nomadic Himba people sometimes change locations with no notice. They are one of the last most traditional peoples of Namibia and have little time for or interest in conventional practices. You will learn about the customs and traditions of this very proud nation, and will be given insight into their beliefs, way of life and everyday routine. The Himba, Tjimba and other Herero people, who inhabit Namibia&#x2019;s remote northwestern Kunene Region, are loosely referred to as the Kaokovelders. The largest group are the Himba, semi-nomads, who live in scattered settlements throughout the Kunene Region. Herero are semi-nomadic pastoralists who tend wander from one watering place to another. For many centuries, they have lived a relatively isolated existence and were not involved to any noteworthy extent in the long struggle for pasturelands between the Nama and the Herero. They are a tall, slender and statuesque people, characterized especially by their proud yet friendly bearing. The women especially are noted for their unusual sculptural beauty, enhanced by intricate hairstyles and traditional adornments. They rub their bodies with red ochre and fat, a treatment that protects their skins against the harsh desert climate. The homes of the Himba of Kaokoland are simple, cone-shaped structures of saplings, bound together with palm leaves and plastered with mud and dung. The men build the structures, while the women mix the clay and do the plastering. A fire burns in the headman&#x2019;s hut day and night, to keep away insects and provide light and heating. A family may move from one home to another several times a year to seek grazing for their goats and cattle. Men, women and children adorn themselves with necklaces, bracelets, anklets and belts made from iron and shell beads. With their unusual and striking designs, these items have gained a commercial value and are being produced on a small scale for the urban market. Sculptural headrests in particular are sought-after items. Later, travel to Grootberg to visit a school, and see the development work that has been done there before returning to camp in time for dinner. &lt;strong&gt;Damaraland Camp (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7: Damaraland / Okonjima - AfriCat Foundation&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you drive southeast to Okonjima Bush Camp at the base of the Omboroko Mountains near Waterberg. &#xA0;Okonjima is home to the AfriCat Foundation, a wildlife sanctuary which focuses on the research and rehabilitation of Africa's big cats, especially injured or captured leopard and cheetah. Close encounters with leopard and cheetah are an unforgettable highlight. You will discuss with your guide your particular interests for your stay here. Activities include leopard tracking by vehicle; a visit to the cheetah welfare project; radio-tracking of the rehabilitated cheetahs, wild dogs and spotted hyaenas on foot; sharing a day in the life of a Bushman during a guided walk; and spending time in the night hide where nocturnal animals such as porcupine, caracal, honey badger and leopard may be seen.&#xA0; The leopards roam freely and catch their own prey within the 20,000-hectare/49,421-acre private, Okonjima Nature Reserve. The Okonjima Bush Suite overlooks a waterhole and is nestled in the open Acacia thorn veld in a secluded wilderness area. It consists of two separate, private, en-suite bedrooms under a magnificent thatched roof, with a fully equipped kitchen. The living space boasts a spacious lounge, a dining area under roof or outside under natural shade, and an open, wood-burning fireplace. The bedrooms have high roofs with fans, air-conditioning and when needed, heating. Each room has two queen-size beds, of which one can be wheeled outside onto the terraces for a night under the stars! Each bedroom has a Wi-Fi or dial-up, internet connection with ample work space. You have a personal host/hostess, chef, guide and game-drive vehicle at your service. &lt;strong&gt;Okonjima Bush Suite (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8: Okonjima - AfriCat Foundation&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;You wake early this morning for another memorable guided activity tailored to your interests before you return for a sumptuous brunch. Your afternoon can be spent relaxing by the swimming pool overlooking the waterhole and enjoying the tranquility of the sun until you go out on another AfriCat excursion after &#x2018;coffee and cake&#x2019; in the afternoon. &lt;strong&gt;Okonjima Bush Suite (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9: Okonjima / Windhoek&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;You will rise early this morning for one last guided activity before you return to Bush Suite for a sumptuous breakfast. Depart for Windhoek in the late morning, via the town of Okahandja, arriving in mid-afternoon, and if time permits, you can visit the Woodcarvers Craft Market in Okahandja if you wish for some last-minute shopping before continuing on to Windhoek. Upon your arrival, you are taken to your hotel. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Olive Exclusive All-Suite Hotel &#x2013; Junior Suite &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10: Windhoek / Maun, Botswana / Okavango Delta &#x2013; Selinda Reserve&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;You have an easy morning to sleep in or take time to explore the city before transferring to the Windhoek International Airport for your international flight to Maun (flight cost additional). Upon arrival in Botswana and after clearing customs, you will meet our representative, who will assist you with the arrangements for your scheduled light aircraft transfer to Selinda Camp in northern Botswana. The afternoon is spent on game-viewing activities arranged by the camp. The comfortable tented safari camp in the Selinda Reserve is on the banks of the eastern Selinda Spillway between Okavango Delta and Chobe National Park. The camp&#x2019;s nine spacious tents are tucked away into the natural vegetation with wonderful views of the palm-studded floodplains. Each tent has an en-suite bathroom and shaded deck. The main area is attractive, cool and under thatch, including dining, lounge and bar areas with spectacular views. Set apart from the main area is the photo and art gallery next to the camp&#x2019;s 500 bottle wine cellar, open-air deck, plunge pool and traditional campfire area. &#xA0;The joins the Okavango Delta with the Linyanti/Kwando waterways, the river systems close to the eastern boundary of Chobe National Park. The reserve follows the Selinda spillway, a dry river that connects the Okavango to the Chobe River. The Spillway flows only in years of high floods and high rainfall. The camp is small and personal, allowing only a handful of guests at one time.&#xA0; You experience a big game safari in the finest African tradition in an area known for elephant, buffalo, red lechwe, giraffe, zebra, impala, kudu, cheetah, wild dog, lion and leopard. There is also some 300 species of birds that inhabit the surrounding marshes and dry country.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Selinda Camp (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11: Linyanti Nature Reserve / Savute Channel&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today you will talk with your guide about your interests, and then join in one of the camp&#x2019;s activities. This includes game drives, night drives, nature walks in the local area and boat/mokoro trips on the river. You also have the option to visit the platforms and hides to watch and photograph animals and birds. &lt;strong&gt;Selinda Camp (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 12: Linyanti Nature Reserve / Okavango Delta&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After one last activity and brunch, your local guide will transfer you to the airstrip for your flight over the Okavango Delta to Little Vumbura. Upon landing at the airstrip, you are met by a local guide and transferred to the camp in time for a light lunch. After settling in and a siesta, you will depart on a game viewing activity of your choice.&#xA0; Little Vumbura is situated in a private concession in the northern part of the Okavango Delta. Here you have the option for varied activities on both land and water. You have the option to spend the rest of the day game viewing, on nature walks, or boating. Surrounded as it is by water and lying close to large rivers, the camp&#x2019;s focus is on water-based activities with mokoros traversing the floodplains under the guidance of experienced polers and motor boats travel up and down the permanent channels. Game drives in open Land Rovers allow guests to get close to animals in the savannah areas. If you like, you can request a walking safari around the islands to enjoy Africa from a different perspective. Game viewing is consistently good year round here with lion, leopard, elephant, sable and buffalo along with extensive plains game. You camp is a beautiful camp with six tents shaded by the canopy of an ancient Okavango Delta forest. Each tent is large and roomy and has en-suite facilities. A plunge pool and reading area overlook the floodplains and a star deck leads off the dining area. &#xA0;The camp is also part of a community participation initiative, bringing the communities that live around the Okavango Delta into the tourism mainstream to provide income, education, medical assistance and employment opportunities. &lt;strong&gt;Little Vumbura Camp (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 13: Okavango Delta&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today you continue to explore this amazing environment. The Okavango River flows inland into the Kalahari Desert, creating a labyrinth of lagoons, lakes and hidden channels covering an area of roughly 15,000 km&#xB2;/5,792 mi&#xB2;.&#xA0; It is the largest inland delta in the world. Trapped in the parched Kalahari sands the Okavango Delta is a magnet for the wildlife who depend on its permanent waters. The Delta is continuously moving, mysterious, placid, gentle and beautiful, from a wide and winding river channel it spreads through tiny, almost unnoticeable channels that creep away behind a wall of papyrus and phragmites reeds, into an ever-expanding network of increasingly smaller passages. These link a succession of lagoons, islands and islets of various sizes, open grasslands and flooded plains in a mosaic of land and water. Palms and towering trees abound, throwing their shade over crystal pools, forest glades and grassy knolls. The Okavango's water is remarkably clean and pure. This is almost certainly because it passes through very sparsely populated areas on its journey from Angola. Despite this, a staggering 660,000 tons of sediment a year are delivered to its great alluvial fan. The overall length of the Delta from the Botswana border to the Thamalakane River is a little less than 300 km/186 mi, and so the core of the Delta is approximately 200 km/124 mi from end to end. &lt;strong&gt;Little Vumbura Camp (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 14: &#xA0;Okavango Delta / Maun / Johannesburg / Depart&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today you will be transferred back to the airstrip for your scheduled light aircraft flight with Wilderness Air Botswana to Maun Airport for your ongoing flight. This is also officially the end of your safari. &lt;strong&gt;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 1, Sat: Lima, Peru&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Welcome to Peru! Upon arrival in Lima, please proceed through Immigration and Customs. After claiming your luggage, exit the Customs Hall where a representative from Big Five will be waiting to assist you and transfer you to your hotel. &lt;strong&gt;Miraflores Park Hotel &#x2013; Ocean View Junior Suite&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2, Sun: Lima&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, join your guide for a half-day city tour. Lima, the center of Spanish power in the New World for three centuries, is the focal point to begin your exploration of this fascinating country. The capital enjoys a considerable legacy of art and architecture from its colonial period, while its museums house artifacts of gold, ceramic, and weavings unearthed from the country's ancient settlements. You will discover Lima&#x2019;s colonial heart, found in its churches, palace, and promenades. Continue to Barranco, one of 43 districts, considered to be the city's most romantic and bohemian because it is home to many of Peru's leading artists, musicians, designers, and photographers. In the 19th century, it was a very fashionable beach resort for the Lime&#xF1;o aristocracy, and many people would spend the summer here and in neighboring Chorillos. There is a beautiful walkway to the sea that runs through Barranco &#x2013; the Bajada de los Ba&#xF1;os. Crossing over this walkway is the Puente de los Suspiros, or Bridge of Sighs. On the far side of the bridge is a park with a statue of Barranco's famous singer and composer, Chabuca Granda. &lt;strong&gt;Miraflores Park Hotel &#x2013; Ocean View Junior Suite (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3, Mon: Lima / Iquitos / Mara&#xF1;on River&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This afternoon, you board&#xA0;your flight to Iquitos. The hour-45-minute flight takes you into the heart of the Peruvian Amazon region. After you&#x2019;ve claimed your luggage, you will board an air-conditioned bus for your hour and a half drive through the Peruvian countryside to the small village of Nauta at road&#x2019;s end. From the moment you step on board, you will enjoy the M/V Aria&#x2019;s atmosphere of low-key luxury. As you settle into your handsomely appointed, over-sized suite, you will feel the vessel begin to move. Take in the view from the upper deck as you leave Iquitos behind.&#xA0; Over the next four days, you will sail along large tributaries of the Amazon, as well as the mighty river itself. You are embarking on a spectacular adventure to a place where few travelers have gone.&#xA0; Later in the air-conditioned lounge, you will learn about life onboard, and will have the first of the nightly briefings about your adventure to follow. You will meet the naturalist guides and the cruise director, who will use video, photos, and maps to explain the details of your journey into the Amazon. Then you sit down to sample some fine South American wine and enjoy outstanding cuisine, created by Executive Chef Pedro Miguel Schiaffino, whose restaurant, Malabar, is the one of the best in all of Lima. Schiaffino&#x2019;s recipes include the imaginative use of local products &#x2013; fruit, fish and spices &#x2013; to make every meal a delightful adventure. The menu always offers choices, including a vegetarian option. &lt;strong&gt;Aboard The M/V Aria (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4, Tue: Mara&#xF1;on River / Choroyacu / San Pedro De Tipishca / Pacaya Samiria National Reserve&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
This morning, board skiffs to explore part of the vast Amazon flooded forest to learn firsthand about the rainforest. Float through a &#x201C;gallery forest,&#x201D; so called because of its narrow vegetation that creates a tunnel of leaves. Return to the M/V Aria for lunch.&#xA0; This afternoon, you set out on a jungle walk to visit a village and meet some of its residents, subsistence farmers. They will tell you how they learned to cultivate wild plants and trees. As your adventure takes you deep into the primary forest, your guides will also show you the wealth of fruit trees and medicinal plants hidden in the jungle. &lt;strong&gt;Aboard The M/V Aria (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Wed:&#xA0; Tacsha River / Pacaya Samiria National Reserve / San Martin De Tipishca&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Today you can choose between two options.&#xA0; You can opt to take a full-day excursion into primary forest on a skiff and travel deep into the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve on the Samiria River. Along the way, you look for some of the abundant wildlife here including several species of monkeys &#x2013; howler, squirrel, saki and saddleback tamarin, and many bird species such as blue, yellow and scarlet macaws, toucans and river hawks. You arrive at the PV2 Tacsha watch post, where you hike into the rainforest and savor picnic lunch in the jungle before returning to your vessel late this afternoon.&#xA0; Alternately, you may choose to go on a guided jungle walk and dolphin expedition.&#xA0; Walk into the primary forest this morning with your naturalist guide to explore one of the sustainable resource management projects in Amazonia. Travel to a village to learn how its residents are planting palms to obtain oil. Your may also see some of the artificial nests created on sand to protect turtle eggs. As you move further into the jungle, you encounter wildlife and learn about the important medicinal value of many jungle plants. See the famous Kapok trees, the tallest trees in the Amazon Basin. Return to the M/V Aria for lunch and some relaxation time. Late this afternoon, you set out on another skiff excursion to search for more wildlife in the jungle canopy.&#xA0; Some 13 species of monkeys reside in the reserve including the small tamarins, dusky titi monkeys and tiny pigmy marmosets. Watch for alligators, and keep your binoculars at the ready, as you are likely to see more than 200 species of birds. As the sun sets and our searchlight comes on, keep your eyes out for caimans, tree boas, tarantulas, and frogs. &lt;strong&gt;Aboard The M/V Aria (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6, Thu: Yanayaquillo / Tahuayo / Charo Lake&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
Back on the river as the sun rises, you see a treasure trove of wildlife, including colorful parrots, macaws and toucans as well as more monkeys. You stop near a poplar dolphin feeding spot and enjoy a &#x201C;bag breakfast&#x201D; of light sandwiches and fresh juice. Return to your ship and begin your journey back toward Iquitos. This afternoon, travel to this splendid &#x201C;hot spot&#x201D; lake, where you will be certain to catch some of the more than 3,000 species of tropical fish that live in the Amazon basin. Our key focus will be on piranhas, those small, sharp-teethed carnivorous fish with a big reputation for being scary. Catching one will make for great cocktail conversation back home. Return to the M/V Aria, which begins its sailing back to Iquitos through the night. This evening, you share a farewell dinner with your shipmates.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Aboard The M/V Aria (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7, Fri: Iquitos / Lima / Depart&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
The excursions today depend on the level of the river. Weather and time permitting, this will be the last opportunity to see how people live along the Amazon by floating in skiffs through the lively riverside community of Belen, in Iquitos. Here, where the houses and shops float on the river during some months, you will see the bustling food market for the entire Peruvian Amazon. All local inhabitants throughout the region sell and purchase goods here.&#xD;
Your afternoon in the remote city of Iquitos, accessible only by river or air, will not disappoint. This bustling town, complete with a house built by Gustave Eiffel, was once a rich center of the rubber industry. Before we head for the airport, we will take you to visit the Manatee Rescue Center, where biologists and volunteers care for endangered Amazon manatees that conservation authorities have seized from local people, including fishermen. Biologists will give a presentation about the project and its efforts to help these helpless mammals. You will also see how the manatees are cared for and are prepared for re-introduction into their natural habitat. Finally, we will stop at the San Juan Amazonian Indian Market, for a last chance to shop for local crafts. Your guides will help you with check-in, and will stay with you until you have boarded your flight back to Lima, where you connect to your flight. &lt;strong&gt;(B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;</tour_itinerary>

&amp;nbsp;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&#xA0;Guatemala City, Guatemala / Antigua&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Guatemala.&#xA0; On arrival in Guatemala City, clear immigration, collect luggage, and proceed through customs.&#xA0; In the arrivals hall, you are met and escorted to the waiting vehicle for transfer to your hotel in Antigua. &lt;strong&gt;Casa Santo Domingo &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antigua / Pacaya Volcano / Antigua&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, your volcanologist guide will meet you in the lobby of your hotel and transfer you to the Pacaya Volcano, where you will set out on a 2.5 hour hike.&#xA0; Active since 1965, this volcano is classified as a strombolian but occasionally plinian. &#xA0;Pacaya recently had a slight increase in volcanic activity, which created several lava rivers. At the top of the volcano, enjoy spectacular views as you savor a picnic-style lunch.&#xA0;&#xA0;Finish off your meal with a unique dessert &#x2013; marshmallows heated by volcanic steam!&#xA0; Return to Antigua to enjoy an afternoon walking tour of this captivating city.&#xA0; Even Antigua&#x2019;s present location is the result of volcanic activity.&#xA0; It was moved here in 1527 after being destroyed in another location by a volcanic eruption. It has the distinct feel of a place lost in time, from its cobblestone streets to its priceless colonial architecture. There is much to explore here &#x2013; art galleries, museums, shops, restaurants, quaint bars and cafes. &lt;strong&gt;Casa Santo Domingo (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Antigua / Lake Atitlan / Antigua&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, board a helicopter for an overflight of the valleys and six different volcanoes &#x2013; Agua, Acatenango, Fuego (active), Atitlan, Toliman, and San Pedro &#x2013; en route to Lake Atitlan. With three stunning volcanoes rising out if its emerald surface, Lake Atitlan is characterized by its natural beauty surrounded by gorgeous views of the volcanoes and its culturally rich indigenous villages.&#xA0; The famous writer, Aldous Huxley, considered it &#x201C;the most beautiful lake in the world&#x201D;.&#xA0; On arrival at the lake, a private boat will take you to the starting point for your kayaking adventure.&#xA0; You will paddle approximately one hour to the base of Cerro de Oro which is a lava dome.&#xA0; This bump was formed from the lava of Atitlan Volcano and the view of the top is simply stunning.&#xA0; After a hike, stop for lunch at Casa Palopo.&#xA0; Transfer back to Antigua by helicopter.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa Santo Domingo (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

&lt;/strong&gt;Early this morning you are transferred to the Guatemala City airport for your flight to Flores. On arrival at the Mundo Maya Airport, you are met and transferred to Flores for breakfast. After breakfast, your guide will transfer you to Uaxactun Archaeological Park, surrounded by 47 hectares of dense tropical rainforest. In addition to its natural beauty, this city was an important center for the development of monumental art during the Preclassic Period (2000 BC &#x2013; 250 AD). You will explore the main plaza, pyramids, and temples. The most impressive ruin is the Structure E-VIIsub, the focal point for the plaza with three temples aligned along its eastern edge. Together these structures were used for astronomical studies. The equinox and solstice were accurately determined by sighting the sunrise from the eastern stairway to one of the three pyramids to the east.&#xA0; Box lunch will be provided. Watch the sun set&#xA0;in the company of an astronomy specialist. &#xA0;Then, you are in for a rare experience&#x2026;&#xA0; &lt;em&gt;glamping &lt;/em&gt;at Uaxactun. This overnight stay in the ruins offers a unique way to experience this ancient Maya site in the comfort of your own private camp.&#xA0;Dinner is served in a special setting near the campsite illuminated with torches and candles.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Glamping At Uaxactun (B,L,D) &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Uaxactun / Tikal / Guatemala City&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Another early wake up allows you to experience sunrise from the top of the main pyramid. After breakfast, travel to Tikal with your driver and guide.&#xA0;The Tikal complex is one of the most famous Maya sites and Guatemala&#x2019;s most significant cultural and natural preserve.&#xA0; Your guide will accompany you throughout the main plaza and temples to explain the history of this massive city and why it was so important. &#xA0;Tikal was a vital ceremonial center of the ancient Maya civilization with the construction of major pyramids and temples.&#xA0; Its best years were the Late Classic Period (600-900AD). After the tour, take a break for lunch at a restaurant near the archaeological site. &#xA0;Your guide will transfer you to Mundo Maya Airport for your flight to Guatemala City.&#xA0;&#xA0;On arrival, you are met and escorted to the waiting vehicle for transfer to your hotel. &#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Westin Camino Real Guatemala (B,L)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;

This is also home to hummingbirds and endemic yellow-eared parrots. On arrival enjoy either hiking or horseback riding. Hike into cloud-forest to experience the lush biodiversity of the flora and fauna. &#xA0;Cross Quindio River on an ecological pathway through the tallest wax-palms in the world. Stop at a trout farm and enjoy a traditional smoked-trout meal.&#xA0; Continue 6 miles towards the small traditional town of Salento. Stroll past the colorful balconies and colonial architecture of Bolivar Square, "calle real," the handicrafts shops and Cocora viewpoint.&#xA0; The town became isolated and therefore has retained more of its colonial architecture than almost any other town in the Coffee Region as well as a quiet and relaxed way of life.&#xA0; Visit the traditional town of Finlandia, a small community economically supported by agriculture and tourism. Although coffee is the major agricultural product, the municipality's diverse ecosystem makes it perfect for the production of fruits and vegetables.

It has stunning colonial churches. Although the city was damaged by an earthquake in 1983, most historic colonial architecture was completely restored. Popayan is also widely-known for the solemnity of its Easter Week sacred processions, a tradition dating back to the 16th century. &#xA0;In 2009, Popayan&#x2019;s Easter Week celebrations were declared by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. During Easter Week, Popay&#xE1;n also hosts the Religious Music Festival.&#xA0; Explore the historic center, concentrating around Caldas Park. The Clock Tower is one of city&#x2019;s symbols, built between 1673-1682. Continue towards the "Humilladero" Bridge, built in 1873 to facilitate access from the city-center to "El Callej&#xF3;n", particularly for those believers making the route on their knees. See the Santo Domingo Church, a baroque-style church, the San Francisco Church, considered the most beautiful baroque church in town, and the "Pantheon to the Independence Heroes". Visit the fascinating Religious Art Museum, and Mosquera House Museum, and the Settecento-style house. &lt;strong&gt;Dann Monasterio (B,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9: Popayan&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, visit the Purace National Park, located 45 km/27 mi away from Popayan.

&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you are in for a treat with a visit the small town of Silvia, located in a temperate mountainous area. Picturesque houses are surrounded by vast sugar-cane plantations. The Indigenous Guambiano community with a population of 12,000 inhabitants, lives in small mountain villages nearby.

This area has been declared as both &#x201C;Mankind&#x2019;s Heritage&#x201D; and &#x201C;Colombian National Heritage&#x201D; site by UNESCO.&#xA0;&#xA0;Its narrow streets are adorned with antique doorways and flower-filled balconies.&#xA0; Explore the colonial streets with stops at the Cathedral of Cartagena, Plaza de Bolivar, and the Temple of Santo Domingo.&#xA0; &lt;strong&gt;Casa San Agustin (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 12: Cartagena&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Quirky and vibrant, with the relentless energy of a Persian bazaar, Bazurto market is a world unto itself. But among the chaos lies a daily routine that begins when vendors arrive from all over the country at the crack of dawn to set up their fish, meat, clothes, antiques, and craft stalls. &#xA0;Join your guide for a morning visit to Bazurto, the largest local food market in Cartagena. Here one can find all the fresh products available in the Caribbean region. Try some of the exotic fruits, and follow your guide, known to the vendors, through this area as they welcome you to their barrio. This is a true local experience. Return to the city center where you will assist the chef of the Collage Charladero restaurant in the preparation of the most known and typical Cartagena recipes including limonada de coco (coconut lemonade) and posta negra (a coconut sweetened beef).

The mud&#x2019;s density means that visitors stay afloat and making this a fun, yet muddy, bath. After the mud bath, head to the freshwater Totumo Lake nearby to wash off the mud before your return to Cartagena. &lt;strong&gt;Casa San Agustin (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 14: Cartagena / Guayaquil, Ecuador&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;You are transferred to the Cartagena airport for your flight to Guayaquil, Ecuador.&#xA0; On arrival, clear immigration, collect luggage, and proceed through customs.&#xA0; In the arrivals hall, you are met and escorted to the waiting vehicle for transfer to your hotel. &lt;strong&gt;Hilton Colon Guayaquil (B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 15: Guayaquil / Santa Cruz Island, The Galapagos&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you fly to the famous Galapagos Islands, which are the result of volcanoes.&#xA0; Your guide meets you at Baltra&#xB4;s airport and drives you through the highlands of Santa Cruz to visit the &#x201C;El Chato&#x201D; reserve.&#xA0; This is the natural habitat of the Galapagos tortoise.&#xA0; Explore the reserve to encounter these lumbering gentle giants and other wildlife such as pintail ducks, egrets, flycatchers, finches, and frigate birds bathing in freshwater lakes.&#xA0; You will also see amazing volcanic tunnels created by hot flowing lava.&#xA0; Continue on to &#x201C;Los Gemelos&#x201D;, two volcanic sinkholes near the top of the island. Walk around these deep craters through a beautiful Scalesia forest covered with epiphytes and ferns.&#xA0; Later in the afternoon, transfer to your accommodations. &lt;strong&gt;Galapagos Safari Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 16: Santa Cruz Island&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;*Depending on the day of the week the excursion to the islands may vary, however, we recommend a&#xA0; visit to Bartholome.&#xA0; &lt;em&gt;Bartholome Island and Sullivan Bay (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#xA0; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The summit trail begins with a dry landing, though sea lions make the dock more exciting.&#xA0; The trail is a dusty walk through volcanic ash. The only vegetation is the &#x201C;pioneer plants&#x201D;, grey Tiquilia and greenish Chamaesyce. These are vital in binding the ash that fans down from the hill. The park wardens have built wooden steps up the hill to prevent further erosion by humans. The reddish spatter cones were minor eruptions of highly viscous material that cooled rapidly. The summit is such a cone; it seems higher than 114 meters/374 feet as you climb the steps.&#xA0; The eastern side has many small lava tubes. If you look carefully, you can make out sunken craters in the sea below. In the distance, you can see most of the central islands, the peaks of Isabela to the west, and, on a clear day, Marchena and Pinta to the north. A good snorkeling place lies at the foot of the Pinnacle Rock that leans into the bay. The cliff is an eroded tuff cone. A small family of Galapagos penguins lives in the shadows of the Pinnacle. You can often spot the penguins on a dingy ride. In the afternoon, return to your tented camp privately nestled on the highlands of Santa Cruz. &lt;strong&gt;Galapagos Safari Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 17: Santa Cruz Island / Isabela Island&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, transfer to Baltra&#x2019;s airport for the interisland flight to Isabela Island.&#xA0; You arrive at your hotel with some time to relax before lunch.&#xA0; This afternoon, visit &#x201C;Las Tintoreras&#x201D;, a set of small islets within the bay. The islets are home to the Galapagos penguin, the only one of this species found in the northern hemisphere.&#xA0; Explore the small, idyllic beaches and coves, and in the offshore waters, you may spot sharks, sea lions, sea turtles and rays.&#xA0; At the end of the day, relax at Puerto Villamil, the island&#xB4;s lazy beach town known for its flamingos and sand streets. &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Iguana Crossing (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 18: Isabela Island&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today, you head into Isabela&#x2019;s volcanic highlands on one of the most impressive hikes in the Galapagos. After driving to the end of the road, you begin your hike into a surreal world of volcanic terrain and the flora is sustains. As you hike, you are surrounded by stunning views of volcanoes and the sea. When you arrive at the rim of Volcan Sierra Negra, you are rewarded with a truly one-of-a-kind vista. This is the second largest active caldera on the planet, six miles across at its widest point. Continue your hike along the rim of this enormous crater.&#xA0; The next leg of our hike continues on to the otherworldly landscapes of the secondary vent Volcan Chico, where spectacular lava formations are painted in vibrant hues by sulfur deposits and puffing fumaroles vent volcanic gases.&#xA0; As we head back, we stop for lunch at a restaurant on the slopes of Sierra Negra, which also serves as a private giant tortoise reserve.&#xA0; After spending the day in this volcanic terrain, we take some time to soak up the atmosphere of Puerto Villamil and relax on the beach. &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Iguana Crossing (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 19: Isabela Island / Baltra / Guayaquil&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Transfer to the island airport for your inter-island flight to Baltra to connect with your flight back to the mainland. You are met and privately transferred to your hotel.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Hilton Colon Guayaquil&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 20: Guayaquil / Depart&#xD;

&lt;/ul&gt;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Windhoek, Namibia&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After landing at Windhoek International Airport, you are welcomed by our representative and transferred into the city. En route to your hotel, enjoy a short city tour. Windhoek, Namibia&#x2019;s capital, nestles among rolling hills, bounded by the Eros Mountains in the east, the Auas Mountains to the south and the Khomas Hochland in the west. It is a blend of Africa and Europe, the modern and the old. The capital&#x2019;s main street is a mix of well-preserved German colonial buildings and modern architectural styles. Herero women in their traditional Victorian dresses mingle with executives dressed in the latest fashions. Check in to the hotel and relax. Hotel Heinitzburg began as a gift from Count von Schwerin to his fianc&#xE9; in 1914. Each room has an elegant incorporating four-poster beds, Italian ceramic floor tiles, custom fittings and specially created, hand-made wood furnishings. Each room is fully equipped with air-condition/heating units, direct telephone lines, electronic safes, mini-bars, televisions with cable channels and music facilities. There is also a sparkling swimming pool, excellent hotel restaurant and inviting sundowner terrace and bar with fantastic views over the city. Dinner tonight is at your leisure. You might want to try the famous &#x201C;Leo&#x2019;s at Castle&#x201D; restaurant. &lt;strong&gt;Hotel Heinitzburg&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Windhoek / East Etosha National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;You board a private charter flight that takes you north over Namibia&#x2019;s central highlands and commercial farmland to the Mokuti Airstrip on the eastern boundary of Etosha National Park. On arrival, you are met by a representative of Mushara who will transfer you to the beautiful Villa Mushara. You check into one of only two exclusive villas that have been designed to create an ideal retreat from the stress of modern day life, where an aura of tranquility prevails. Arrive in time for lunch, and then relax and enjoy your villa before heading out for an exciting game drive inside the park.&#xA0; Days on safari have their own rhythm with morning and evening game drives in search of lion, giraffe, blue wildebeest, eland, kudu, gemsbok, zebra, rhino, cheetah, leopard, hyena, honey badger and warthog, as well as the endemic black- faced impala dominate the predator food chain. Savor the timeless appeal of Etosha&#x2019;s enduring mystique. &lt;strong&gt;Villa Mushara (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Eastern Etosha National Park&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today is spent game viewing within the Etosha National Park, returning to the villa for lunch. Later in the afternoon, venture out for more game viewing in the park. The park covers 22,270km&#xB2;, of which approximately 5,000km&#xB2; is made up of saline depressions or &#x2018;pans&#x2019;. The largest of these pans, the Etosha Pan, can be classified as a saline desert in its own right. The Etosha Pan lies in the Owambo Basin, on the northwestern edge of the Namibian Kalahari Desert. Until three million years ago it formed part of huge, shallow lake that was reduced to a complex of salt pans when the major river that fed it, the Kunene, changed course and began to flow to the Atlantic. If the lake existed today, it would be the third largest in the world. The park consists of grassland, woodland and savannah. Game-viewing centers around the numerous springs and waterholes where several different species can often be seen at one time. The park boasts some 114 mammal and over 340 bird species. &lt;strong&gt;Villa Mushara (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: Eastern Boundary of Etosha / Serra Cafema&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After a leisurely breakfast, you board your private light aircraft flight to travel further north and west into the Kaokoland Region and the Kunene River, Namibia&#x2019;s northernmost border. On arrival, you are welcomed by your guide transferred by road through stunning scenery to your camp. You arrive in time for lunch. Serra Cafema is an exclusive, remote retreat on the banks of the Kunene River in the Hartmann&#x2019;s Valley of the northwestern Kaokoland. Combining breathtaking desert landscapes with river views, the magnificent thatched and canvas en suite tents are elevated and shaded by ancient Albida trees. The main area includes a bar, lounge, pool and curio shop. The area surrounding Serra Cafema is inhabited only by the nomadic Ova-Himba people. When the villages are in the area, then you have the opportunity to learn about this culture with its relatively untouched lifestyle and traditions. Activities include quad biking (ATV&#x2019;s) and 4x4 nature drives to explore the surrounding area of dunes and rugged mountains; boat trips; fishing; bird watching and guided walks. &lt;strong&gt;Serra Cafema (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 5: Serra Cafema / Hartmann Valley&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Today, you savor exciting and informative guided activities that revolve around the exploration of surrounding Namib Desert sands and the lush oasis along the river. Enlightening nature drives and carefully guided quad bike excursions through the fragile dunes allow guests to experience the true Namib. The utmost care is taken to tread lightly on the dunes and preserve the unique and delicate habitats of this fascinating landscape. Boating (seasonal) on the Kunene River gives you the opportunity to venture through the lush riverside oasis. Crocodiles and water birds seem out of place in this surreal, lunar-like landscape. Also, in the Hartmann's Valley, you see examples of the remarkable &lt;em&gt;fairy circle&lt;/em&gt; phenomenon. These circles are thought to be associated with sand termites, and only occur in a narrow belt of African desert with very specific environmental conditions. Walking in the remote mountain and river valleys is also a highlight, as is a visit to a Himba settlement - one of the last true nomadic people in Africa. The Himba, Tjimba and other Herero people who inhabit Namibia&#x2019;s remote northwestern Kunene Region are loosely referred to as the Kaokovelders. They are semi-nomadic pastoralists who migrate from one watering place to another. They seldom leave their home areas and, for many centuries, they have lived a relatively isolated existence. &#xA0;The largest group of Kaokovelders is the Himba, semi-nomads who live in scattered settlements throughout the Kunene Region. They are a tall, slender and statuesque people, characterized especially by their proud yet friendly bearing. The women especially are noted for their unusual sculptural beauty, enhanced by intricate hairstyles and traditional adornments. They rub their bodies with red ochre and fat, a treatment that protects their skins against the harsh desert climate. The homes are simple, cone-shaped structures of saplings, bound together with palm leaves and plastered with mud and dung. The men build the structures, while the women mix the clay and do the plastering. A fire burns in the headman&#x2019;s hut day and night, to keep away insects and provide light and heating. A family may move from one home to another several times a year to seek grazing for their goats and cattle. A Himba woman spends as much as three hours a day on her appearance. First she bathes, then she anoints herself with her own individually prepared mixture which not only protects her skin from the harsh desert sun, but also keeps insects away and prevents her hair from falling out. She uses another mixture of butter fat, fresh herbs and black coals to rub on her hair, and &#x2018;steams&#x2019; her clothes regularly over the permanent fire. Men, women and children adorn themselves with necklaces, bracelets, anklets and belts made from iron and shell beads. With their unusual and striking designs, these items have gained a commercial value and are being produced on a small scale for the urban market. Sculptural headrests in particular are sought-after items. &lt;strong&gt;Serra Cafema (B,L,D)&#xA0; &lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 6: Serra Cafema / Damaraland&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, you return to the airstrip for your private light aircraft flight south into Damaraland. During the transfer to the camp, keep an eye out for some of the exceptional species of flora and fauna that can be found here. You arrive with time to freshen up and settle in before lunch. This afternoon you can either enjoy a guided walk in the local area or a guided excursion to the ancient Twyfelfontein rock engravings and the interesting geological sites of Burnt Mountain and the Organ Pipes (or there is plenty of time to do this tomorrow if preferred). At Twyfelfontein, some 2,500 prehistoric engravings that depict wildlife, animal spoor and abstract motifs are scattered on boulders over a hillside amongst flat-topped mountains of red sandstone. These boulders and slabs of red sandstone hold perhaps the largest and finest collection of petroglyphs in Africa. The engravings show animals such as elephant, giraffe, kudu, lion, rhinoceros, springbok, zebra and ostrich that once used to drink from a fountain at the bottom of the hill. In some cases, footprints were engraved instead of hooves or paws. The abstract motifs feature mainly circles. Stone tools and other artifacts found at Twyfelfontein suggest that hunter-gatherers occupied the site over a period of perhaps 7,000 years. A local guide accompanies you to showcase the rock art. The engravings lie along two circular routes, one an hour&#x2019;s climb and the other 40 minutes longer. Twyfelfontein is one of Namibia&#x2019;s key National Monuments and has recently become a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A rounded hill a few kilometers from Twyfelfontein and the Organ Pipes, known as the Burnt Mountain, seems to catch fire again at sunrise and sunset. Its fantastic range of colors is due to a chemical reaction that took place roughly 125 million years ago when molten lava penetrated organic shale and limestone deposits, resulting in contact metamorphism. In ordinary sunlight it is a dull black. Blackened rubble lies to one side like cinders. The Organ Pipes are another geological curiosity in the area consisting of a mass of perpendicular dolerite columns that intruded the surrounding rocks also about 125 million years ago and have since been exposed in a ravine due to river erosion.&#xA0; Your camp is situated in the rugged beauty of the northern slopes of the Huab River. This private paradise offers stunning silence, beauty and tranquility with nine large, luxury walk-in canvas tents, each with en suite bathroom. The dining room, pub and curio shop are combined under canvas with an open fire nearby. Activities here include nature walks and nature drives. The expert and experienced guides will give you new insight into this unique desert environment. &lt;strong&gt;Damaraland Camp (B,L,D)&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7: Damaraland&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After an early breakfast, set out on a 4x4 excursion along the ephemeral Huab and Aba Huab River Valleys to explore this remarkable region and to search for game, including the elusive desert-adapted elephants if they are in the area. Damaraland is home to a variety of desert-adapted wildlife and hidden desert treasures. In habitats with sufficient vegetation and water, an adult elephant consumes as much as 300kg/661 lbs of roughage and 230 liters/61 gallons of water every day of its life. Consider what a herd of them would eat and drink in a week or a month or a year. An African elephant in a desert? Yes, and other large mammals as well, such as black rhinoceros and giraffe. Their ranges extend from river catchments in northern Kaokoveld as far south as the northern Namib. Apart from the Kunene River, seven rivers run from the Ugab, with the largest being are the Hoarusib, the Hoanib, the Huab and the Ugab Rivers. Desert adapted elephant in Kaokoland and the Namib walk further for water and fodder than any other elephant in Africa. The distances between waterholes and feeding grounds can be as great as 68 km/42 mi. The typical home range of a family herd is eight times as big as ranges in central Africa where rainfall is much higher. They walk and feed at night and rest during the day. To meet their nutritional and bulk requirements they browse on no fewer than 74 of the 103 plant species that grow in their range. Not a separate species or even a subspecies, they are an ecotype unique to Namibia in Africa south of the equator, behaviorally adapted to hyper-arid conditions. Elephant in Mali on the southwestern fringe of the Sahara Desert are the only others known to survive in similar conditions. You return to camp for lunch and the rest of the afternoon can be spent in leisure at the lodge or take a walk with your local lodge guide into the local area around camp. &lt;strong&gt;Damaraland Camp (B,L,D)&#xA0;&#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8: Damaraland / Sossusvlei / NamibRand Nature Reserve&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;After an early breakfast, you are transferred to the airstrip for your private light aircraft flight south to Wolwedans Dune Lodge. The flight takes you along the Skeleton Coast, flying over ship wrecks, seal colonies and old diamond mining camps. You will also fly over the great sand sea and stopover in Swakopmund to refuel before passing by Sossusvlei and landing at Sossusvlei Lodge airstrip. Here you will be met by a local guide who will take you on a magical excursion into the Namib Naukluft National Park, entering the park gates in the late morning. Sossusvlei itself is actually a clay pan set amidst these star shaped dunes, which stand up to 300 meters/984 feet above the surrounding plains, ranking them among the tallest dunes on earth. This area boasts some of the highest free-standing sand dunes in the world. Your guide will give you an insight on the formation of the Namib Desert and its myriad of fascinating creatures and plants that have adapted to survive these harsh environs. Once you have explored the dune fields to your heart&#x2019;s content, you will be transferred to Sossusvlei lodge in time for delectable lunch before returning to the airstrip and continue on your short flight to the Wolwedans airstrip.&#xA0; You are met by your local guide, who drives you to the lodge. This afternoon if time allows, you are treated to an inspiring sundowner nature drive within the NamibRand Nature Reserve. This area around what has become known as &#x201C;Chateau Plains&#x201D; is a landscape photographer&#x2019;s paradise &#x2013; especially in the late afternoon light. &#xA0;This is one of the largest private nature reserves in Southern Africa, begun as a conservation initiative in 1984. &#xA0;It encompasses more than 180,000 hectares/444,790 acres of pristine Namib Desert, restoring land that was once used for Karakul sheep farming. The reserve shares a common border with the Namib-Naukluft National Park to the west, while the imposing Nubib mountain range forms a natural border to the east. The particular attraction of NamibRand is its diversity of desert landscapes, representing virtually all facets of the Namib Desert. Expansive sand and gravel plains and endless stretches of grass savannah alternate with majestic mountain ranges and vegetated dune belts of deep red sand. Your lodge is perched on top of a dune plateau. The building style is a combination of wooden poles and large canvas blinds/windows that open up to the desert beyond. Each of the spacious en-suite chalets leads onto a private veranda and stretches of untouched sand. The main complex consists of two lounges, two dining rooms, and a number of sundowner decks, a fireplace, library, wine cellar, and a swimming pool. &lt;strong&gt;Wolwedans Dunes Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 9/10: NamibRand Nature Reserve&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Explore the Namib Rand Nature Reserve in-depth over the next two days. Whether you discover nature&#x2019;s miracles on foot, by land rover or from the air, you will be astounded by the multi-faceted desert habitat, home to the most intriguing desert-adapted flora and fauna. Scenic drives and/or flights and nature walks with resident field guides reveal the fascinating wonders of the NamibRand Nature Reserve. Go on a picnic in the wild, savor sundowners on the dunes and dinners by candlelight. For active travelers who want a really close-up experience with this amazing landscape, you can arrange to go on a two-day guided walk on the TokTokkie Trails, a separate concession on the reserve.&#xA0; Hot-air ballooning over the dune belts and never-ending plains provides unforgettable, breathtaking vistas. From the best viewpoint imaginable, you admire the stark beauty of the Namib for about an hour, before celebrating this once-in-a-lifetime experience with a champagne breakfast at the landing spot. &lt;strong&gt;Wolwedans Dunes Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NamibRand Nature Reserve / Windhoek / Depart&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning after breakfast, you return to the local airstrip in time for your private charter light aircraft flight to the Windhoek International Airport. When you land at the airport, you are met by a representative who will help you connect with your onward flight.</tour_itinerary>

The collective term refers to a wide-ranging ethnicity of groups who share a common social, religious and economic structure, as well as a common linguistic heritage as Mapudungun speakers. Because they were spread out and separated into family clans, the Mapuche were able to resist the Spanish invaders for 300 years. They were never conquered. The Mapuche community today is working to maintain a proud heritage through a number of initiatives, including workshops that benefit local students such as art, painting, dance, wood carving, music, and baking and chocolate-making. &#xA0;You interact with members of this community and learn about their rich traditions, customs and mythology. &lt;strong&gt;Nawelpi Lodge - Double room (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&amp;nbsp;</tour_highlights>
    <tour_itinerary>&lt;strong&gt;Day 1: Quito, Ecuador&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Welcome to Ecuador!&#xA0;Upon arrival, after your baggage is collected, you are welcomed by your Big Five representative, who escorts you to your private vehicle. Your driver will be waiting for you to transfer you to your hotel. During the drive, your guide will go over your schedule for the next day and answer any questions you may have.&#xA0;Situated in a newly-restored historic mansion overlooking Plaza San Francisco, the three-story Casa Gangotena Boutique&#xA0;Hotel harbors 31&#xA0;rooms,&#xA0;a showcase of&#xA0;eye-catching style, contemporary&#xA0;design, antiques,&#xA0;fine furnishings, modern technologies and quintessential comforts.&#xA0;Beautiful, eclectically appointed, the hotel invites you to explore. Relax, whether in the dining room, glassed-in patio, garden redolent with the perfume of native flowers, wood-paneled library, or else atop its panoramic third-floor terrace. &lt;strong&gt;Casa Gangotena&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 2: Quito /&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Mashpi Rainforest Biodiversity Reserve&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;After breakfast, you set out to the north on a drive to the cloud forest, about 900 m/3,116 ft above sea level, where you will spend the next days. Here in the Mashpi Rainforest Biodiversity Reserve you are surrounded by lower montane rainforest and cloud forest that host a profusion of plant species, from ferns and bromeliads to hundreds of orchid species, many newly-discovered. Some 500 species of bird &#x2013; including some 36 endemics &#x2013; are estimated to inhabit the forest. Monkeys, peccaries and even puma make their homes inside the reserve that is crisscrossed with waterfalls. Mashpi Lodge is set within a 2,600-acre private reserve. As you pass the Equator you climb out of dry valleys before gently descending towards the Pacific, the vegetation around you becoming ever-more verdant and abundant with every turn of the road. Incredibly quickly, you find yourself surrounded by forest and tumbling mountains on all sides, as the road winds downhill towards a private reserve of protected forest. Mashpi Lodge was designed as the ideal springboard for exploring the biodiversity of its surroundings. It combines the highest standards of comfort, service, guiding and cuisine that you expect. Discover life in the tree tops, trekking along trails, listening to animal calls, bathing in pure waterfalls, or simply relaxing with a view of clouds playing hide and-seek with the forest.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Mashpi Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 3: Mashpi Rainforest Biodiversity Reserve&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;Explore your magnificent surroundings with activities suited to your interests. Your guides help you discover the forest during walks and hikes in the forest along trails. Due to Mashpi&#x2019;s mountainous topography, trails are rarely flat. The Howler Monkey (mainly primary forest) and Cucharillo (mainly secondary), although short, are steep. Both trails have been specially adapted to make walking easier, using embedded recycled plastic crates to create steps and firm paths. Take a dip in refreshing waterfalls; visit a butterfly and frog exhibition center; head to a reforested area for wildlife observation; or an area designed for observing dozens of species of amazing hummingbirds. These activities are complemented by the knowledge and enthusiasm of naturalist and local Guides, who will accompany the small groups throughout their stay. In the evenings, guides give presentations and briefings for a deeper understanding of the forest&#x2019;s ecosystem and biodiversity.&lt;strong&gt; Mashpi Lodge (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 4: Mashpi / Tulipe /&#xA0; Zuleta&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning, you transfer by private car in a one hour drive to Tulipe Archaeological Site, originally built by the Yumbo people who lived in the valleys and mountains surrounding Quito between 800 and 1660 A.D. No one really knows what happened to these ancient people, but it is surmised that they might have migrated to the Amazon basin after the Pichincha Volcano erupted in 1660. The various finds and their relative positions point to an advanced people, who may have, at one point controlled the important trade route between the Andes and Amazon and the Pacific coast. Following your visit to Tulipe, continue on (approx. 3-hour drive) to Compania Hacienda for lunch. Located in the beautiful valley of Cayambe, the hacienda was built in 1919 in French neoclassical style, and has belonged to the same family for generations. Following lunch, continue to Hacienda Zuleta, a colonial working farm encompassing 2,000 hectares/4,000 acres that has for a century belonged to the family of Galo Plaza Lasso, a former president of Ecuador.&#xA0; It was chosen as one of the world&#x2019;s &#x201C;Top Ten Finds&#x201D; by &lt;em&gt;Outside&lt;/em&gt; magazine and named as one of the best Ecuador Hotel by &lt;em&gt;National Geographic Traveler.&lt;/em&gt; Your hosts welcome you with some afternoon tea or coffee. After planning your stay, you learn about the hacienda&#x2019;s history, see the ex- President Galo Plaza Lasso&#x2019;s private library, the chapel and beautiful gardens. As sun sets it can get chilly so you are invited to enjoy some wine and farm-made Ecuadorian cheese beside the fireplace. Learn about their horse-breeding business or about the local culture of Ecuador in the highlands. &lt;strong&gt;Hacienda Zuleta (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Days 5/6: Zuleta&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;You have several options to explore over the next two days. You can begin each day with one of the short hikes before breakfast and do some bird watching along the way. You can visit the cheese factory to learn more about Zuleta&#xB4;s semi-aged, handmade Ecuadorian cheeses, and how the process has changed throughout history. Mornings are also the best time look for the endangered Ecuadorian condor. You can opt to huike, bike or ride horses to the Andean Condor Reserve, just three kilometers/1.9 miles from the guesthouse. You will learn about the foundation&#x2019;s efforts, see rescued Andean condors in our aviary, and visit a nearby trout farm. The route back takes you through pasture land where you see ancient monuments of the Caranqui culture &#x2013; small burial mounds dating back to 700 A.D. and giant ceremonial truncated ramp pyramids from the 13th century. For lunch, enjoy freshly caught trout and Ecuador cuisine. If you have coffee in the patio, you will likely see a giant hummingbird that comes frequently to feed here. You can shop for beautiful, handmade, colorful embroidery articles made by the local Zuleta women&#x2019;s cooperative. Take a delightful horse drawn carriage down the eucalyptus alley to visit the foundation-run library, where local children spend their afternoons getting help with homework, reading and playing. You can choose a more challenging hike up to Condor View, which offers wonderful views of the local area and you may even be lucky enough to spot a family of spectacle bears along the way. &#xA0;You can visit a local shaman on the other side of Mount Imbabura to learn about ancient healing and energy balancing techniques &#x2013; by special arrangement. &lt;strong&gt;Hacienda Zuleta&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 7: Zuleta / Quito / Baltra Island, Galapagos / Santa Cruz Island&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;A special adventure begins as you transfer to Quito airport and fly to the Galapagos Islands.&#xA0; You will then meet with a cruise representative, who assists you with check-in for your five-night cruise aboard the M/C Athala II.&#xA0; After an introductory and safety briefing, enjoy lunch on board before you prepare for your first excursion. Although an itinerary of the daily cruise schedule is provided below, &lt;em&gt;it should be used only as a guideline.&lt;/em&gt; Cruise itineraries in the Galapagos are regularly affected by seasonal factors and by national park authorities&#x2019; daily directives. Your on-board naturalist-guide will give briefings on the daily excursions. Amazingly, each site is a distinct ecosystem unto itself, where you&#x2019;ll enjoy a unique mix of tropical and polar wildlife. In the Galapagos, you discover flightless birds, playful sea lions, and a bounty of birds, tortoises and iguanas &#x2013; each specially adapted to the specific island habitat.&#xA0; Time will allow for observations of the incredibly unique flora, fauna and volcanic terrain by foot, on panga excursions, guided hikes, relaxing beach walks, snorkeling and swimming! You will access islands either by wet or dry landing.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;Wet Landings &lt;/em&gt;Wet Landings are landings on the beach rather than on the shore. Passengers go ashore by swinging their legs over the side of the panga and then stepping off into approximately a foot of water, and finally wading to shore. The process is relatively easy and is done in reverse to board the panga. Unless wearing Tevas or other aqua shoes, the wet landing is made barefoot. Then once on shore there is a few minutes to dry feet and try to remove as much sand as possible before putting on shoes and socks before the natural history walk. Bringing two towels or wash clothes on a wet landing is highly recommended. One towel is used to put your feet on while the other towel is used to dry the feet and get the sand off.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;Dry Landings &lt;/em&gt;Dry Landings are made in areas where the passenger can exit the panga directly on to a rock or lava surface. Shoes can be worn for the duration of a dry landing. This is actually the more difficult landing since the panga continues to move while passengers attempt to step off the boat on to a slippery surface. Good balance and paying attention to what you are doing are key to a successful dry landing. The guide will go ashore first and offer you a hand. Boarding the panga is done in the same fashion the guide or a crewmember will offer a hand to everyone as they re-board the panga.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;PM: Mosquera Islet &lt;/em&gt;This tiny islet is actually home to a huge population of sea lions and is also home to many shorebirds. While at Mosquera, keep your eyes peeled as there are occasional reports of dolphins and orcas. Difficulty Level: Easy. &lt;strong&gt;M/C Athala II (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 8: Galapagos Islands&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;AM: Sullivan Bay, Santiago Island &lt;/em&gt;Sullivan Bay is known for its spectacular volcanic formations, relatively young pahoehoe lava flows, and unique geological scenery. Sullivan&#x2019;s relatively recent volcanic activity, few plants have been able to take root here, much less be successful, so pay particular interest to the low-lying pioneer plant known locally as &#x201C;mollugo&#x201D; as well as the lava cactus. This morning excursion includes a hike and some time for snorkeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;PM: Bartolome Island &lt;/em&gt;Bartolome is a small island that has two visitor sites. At the first site, you can snorkel around Pinnacle Rock, where penguins are usually seen. Then, it&#x2019;s back on board for a quick change of clothes followed by a short dinghy ride to a dry landing for a climb to the highest point on the island. On the way up, you &#xA0;encounter different volcanic formations, including spatter and tuffcones, lava flow and lava tubes. From the summit you will have a wonderful view of Sullivan Bay. For those not interested in the hike, there is the option of a panga ride. Usual fauna and flora also includes sea lions, pioneer plants, reef sharks, rays and colorful reef fish. Walk up 375 low-grade stairs to top of volcano at a slow to moderate pace. Difficulty Level: Moderate. &lt;strong&gt;M/C Athala II (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 9: Galapagos Islands&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;AM: Urbina Bay, Isabela Island &lt;/em&gt;Urbina Bay is located in Western Isabela, at the foot of Alcedo volcano. This is the spot where the Galapagos National Park began their successful eradication of goats on Isabela Island. After a wet landing on a beautiful black-sand beach, you may be able to observe sea turtle nesting sites. This area is also known for penguin and flightless cormorant sightings and is one of the best places to see Darwin&#x2019;s finches as well as large land iguanas. Also, be on the lookout for Galapagos tortoises which like to feed within the site&#x2019;s dense vegetation. Incredible view of the whole cove and Darwin Lake. Difficulty Level: Moderate.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;PM: Tagus Cove, Isabela Island &lt;/em&gt;Tagus Cove was historically used as an anchoring place for pirates, buccaneers and whalers. Here you will see the names of hundreds of ships painted on the high ridges (a practice now forbidden). On the hike, the trail goes through an area of vegetation and the volcanic landscape of Darwin volcano. At the top of the trail, you will enjoy a brisk &#x201C;power-hike&#x201D; followed by kayaking or a panga ride, where you will have the opportunity to see a large number of blue-footed boobies perched on the ledges of the cliffs, as well as marine iguanas, penguins, brown pelicans, brown noddy terns and swallow-tailed gulls. While exploring the channel between Fernandina and Isabela Islands, we sometimes encounter dolphins and whales. Difficulty Level: Easy to Difficult (panga ride is easy, hike up to lake can be strenuous for some). &lt;strong&gt;M/C Athala II (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 10: Galapagos Islands&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;AM: Fernandina Island &lt;/em&gt;Fernandina Island is one of the most pristine ecosystems in the entire world and also one of the most dynamic. La Cumbre Volcano last erupted in April 2009. It dominates the landscape, with lava fields stretching towards the ocean from its base. Punta Espinoza is a narrow piece of land where some of the most unique Galapagos species can be seen, including the flightless cormorant, Galapagos snakes, marine iguanas, penguins and the Galapagos hawk. Difficulty Level: Moderate.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;PM: Punta Vicente Roca, Isabela Island &lt;/em&gt;Punta Vicente Roca is a wonderful snorkeling site, where you can usually see turtles as well as all kinds of fish. For those who do not snorkel, a panga ride will give you the opportunity to study some of the Galapagos&#x2019; spectacular geological rock formations. Nazca boobies, pelicans, swallow-tailed gulls, marine iguanas, flightless cormorants and penguins are often seen in the area. Difficulty Level: Easy to moderate. &lt;strong&gt;M/C Athala II (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 11: Galapagos Islands&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;AM: Puerto Egas, Santiago Island &lt;/em&gt;Puerto Egas, or James Island, is located on the northwest side of Santiago Island. The landing is on a black beach with eroded rock formations in the distance. The trail crosses the dry interior, where the remains of a salt mining enterprise can still be seen, before continuing along the coast. Tidal pools are home to a variety of invertebrate organisms, including sea urchins, octopus and starfish. You will also see marine iguanas, finches, oyster catchers and possibly the Galapagos Hawk. The trail leads to the Fur Sea Lion Grottos, one of the only places in the islands where these unique animals can be seen. After the walk, you will have time to swim or snorkel off the beach, where you will see sea lions, fish and maybe some turtles, rays and maybe some reef sharks. Difficulty Level: Easy to Moderate.&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;em&gt;PM: Espumilla Beach, Santiago Island &lt;/em&gt;This afternoon&#x2019;s visit is to the northern coast of Santiago Island in James Bay. This is a wet landing. The main attractions here are a Palo Santo forest, beach and the landscape. The Palo Santo forest at Espumilla has some of the tallest specimens of the species in the entire archipelago. Also look out for the Galapagos Hawk as well as Darwin&#x2019;s finches. The beach is an important site for nesting marine turtles. Difficulty level: Easy. &lt;strong&gt;M/C Athala II (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 12: Galapagos Islands / Santa Cruz Island - Galapagos Safari Camp&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;AM:Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz Island &lt;/em&gt;After breakfast, you will disembark the Athala II for the last time.&#xA0; You are then transferred to the Charles Darwin Research Station, accompanied by a guide. After a quick and informative visit of the Research Station, you will be met by your naturalist guide from Galapagos Safari Camp who will accompany you for lunch and a complete tour of the highlands. You visit Los Gemelos, collapsed twin craters that were formed by a series of eruptions when the island was still active. This area is one of the few where the Scalesia forest is almost intact. Tortoises wander around, finches and vermilion fly catchers can also be seen. You experimence total darkness and learn about the formation of these fascinating islands in the lava tunnels.&#xA0; Arrive at Galapagos Safari Camp for a sunset drink and dinner. Galapagos Safari Camp is a 55-hectare farm in the highlands of Santa Cruz Island bordering the national park, 30 minutes from the sea. The farm is rich in birdlife with finches, warblers, mockingbirds, galapagos doves, egrets and owls &#x2014; tortoises also make frequent visits. The farm has many local species of trees, such as scalesia, guayabillo, and palo santo which are rapidly regaining a foothold after years of cattle farming. The camp has eight luxury safari tents perched on a hill, providing comfort and privacy in the wilderness. All tents have a balcony with views of the park and the ocean &#x2014; they are spacious, attractively decorated, and each has a private bathroom, with hot shower and loo. Guests can gather by the fireplace in the main room to view the sunsets, taste our chef&#xB4;s creative dishes that cater for the international palate in the panoramic dining room or enjoy the tranquility of the infinity pool with fabulous ocean scenery. &lt;strong&gt;Galapagos Safari Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 13: Santa Cruz Island - Galapagos Safari Camp&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;The trail begins at the village of Bellavista and takes you to some of the biggest hills of the island: Media Luna, Puntudo and Cerro Crocker. Ornithologists will thrive in this area as there are several bird species that can be observed such as rails, finches and petrels. &lt;strong&gt;Galapagos Safari Camp (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
&lt;strong&gt;Day 14: Galapagos Islands / Guayaquil / Depart&#xD;
&lt;/strong&gt;This morning you are transferred to Baltra Airport to board your private plane to Guayaquil, and connect to your international flight out. &lt;strong&gt;(B)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

Your guide waits at the airstrip to take you to Manyara Ranch, a 35,000-acre wildlife conservancy in the corridor between Tarangire and Manyara National Parks. Originally established as a cattle ranch during Tanzania's colonial period, Manyara Ranch remains an operating ranch with a relatively small herd of beef cattle and black-headed sheep. In 2000, the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) obtained management and conservation rights to the ranch to protect these vital wildlife corridors. In so doing, they established a working relationship with the Maasai community, developing conservation projects and rehabilitating the ranch itself. The ranch is held in trust by the Tanzania Land Conservation Trust (TLCT) for the benefit of the local communities and Tanzania.&#xA0;&lt;strong&gt;Manyara Ranch Conservancy (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;

The conservancy provides guided bush walks, day and night game drives, visits to partner villages (in an authentic setting) and activities including horseback riding with big game and bush breakfasts and dinners. You can also participate in research activities that promote the on-going conservation projects in collaboration with the African Wildlife Foundation. There are several large dams on the ranch that attract and help retain the wildlife within the conservancy area. There is a significant resident population of wildlife including groups of large bull elephants, breeding herds of giraffe, many lesser kudu, wildebeest, zebra, gazelle, oryx and eland. There are also predators, including lion, cheetah, leopard, hyena, jackal and bat-eared foxes. For many years, wild dogs have denned on the ranch. The resident game population is continually being increased by wildlife moving through the migratory corridors. There are large numbers of bird species, including many raptors. Manyara Ranch has a variety of habitats, which include open savannah, acacia woodland, bush and riverine forest. These habitats support a large diversity of wildlife. &lt;strong&gt;Manyara Ranch Conservancy (B,L,D)&lt;/strong&gt;&#xD;
